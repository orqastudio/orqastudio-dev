title: Implement full skill content injection in rule-engine.mjs
description: "Currently skill injection returns skill names as a list. Change it to read the actual SKILL.md file content and inject it as systemMessage so agents receive the knowledge, not just a reference."

acceptance:
  - "collectSkillIds() resolves skill names to .orqa/process/skills/{name}/SKILL.md paths"
  - "Skill file content is read, YAML frontmatter stripped, body returned as systemMessage"
  - Deduplication still works via .injected-skills.json (no re-injection of already-loaded skills)
  - "Missing skill files produce a warning message, not a crash"
  - Injected content is returned alongside any warn/block verdicts

    type: delivers
    rationale: Core task — makes skill injection meaningful instead of just naming skills

## Scope

### rule-engine.mjs Changes (lines 156-177)

Current `collectSkillIds()`:
```js
return `**Read before implementing:**\n${newIds.map((id) => `- ${id}`).join("\n")}`;
```

Target:
```js
const contents = newIds.map(id => {
  const path = resolve(ROOT, '.orqa/process/skills', id, 'SKILL.md');
  if (!existsSync(path)) return `[WARNING: Skill '${id}' not found at ${path}]`;
  const raw = readFileSync(path, 'utf-8');
  // Strip YAML frontmatter
  const body = raw.replace(/^---[\s\S]*?---\n*/, '');
  return `## Skill: ${id}\n\n${body}`;
}).join('\n\n---\n\n');
return contents;
```

### Edge Cases

- Skill directory exists but SKILL.md missing → warning message
- Skill file has no frontmatter → return raw content
- Large skill files → consider truncation if systemMessage has size limits
