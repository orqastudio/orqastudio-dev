## Pattern

During [EPIC-4726cb3b](EPIC-4726cb3b), the orchestrator reported [TASK-c75be77c](TASK-c75be77c) (AD-2aa4d6db SQLite governance table removal) as documentation-only and deferred the actual table removal to a future epic. This violated [RULE-e120bb70](RULE-e120bb70) (no deferred deliverables) — the task's acceptance criteria explicitly included removing the tables, not just documenting the violation.

The root cause: the orchestrator treated "document the gap" as equivalent to "resolve the gap" when the acceptance criteria clearly required resolution.

## Fix

1. Always read acceptance criteria literally — if it says "removed from SQLite", the tables must be removed
2. If a task's implementation scope is larger than expected, report the scope to the user and ask for direction — do not silently reduce scope
3. [RULE-e120bb70](RULE-e120bb70) already covers this pattern; the violation was a compliance failure, not a missing rule
