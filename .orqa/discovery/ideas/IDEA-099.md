title: Personas as first-class artifacts
description: "Personas (Alex, Sam, Jordan) should be a first-class artifact type with their own schema, frontmatter, and relationships — not a static documentation page."

## Motivation

Personas (Alex, Sam, Jordan) are currently defined as a static documentation page. They cannot be referenced in the artifact graph, cannot have relationships to epics or features, and are not browsable as structured artifacts. Elevating personas to first-class artifacts would allow features and epics to declare which persona they serve, making pillar alignment and user-centredness traceable through the graph rather than implied by prose.

## Sketch

A new artifact type `PERSONA-NNN` in `.orqa/delivery/personas/` with a schema covering name, role, goals, frustrations, and pillar alignment. Epics and ideas gain an optional `personas` field listing which personas the work serves. The artifact browser gains a Personas section. The Designer role gains persona-awareness when generating UI plans.
