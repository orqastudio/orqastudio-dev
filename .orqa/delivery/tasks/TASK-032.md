title: Create code-search wrapper skill
description: Creates a context-detecting wrapper skill that instructs agents to load the appropriate concrete search skill depending on whether they are running in CLI or App context.

acceptance:
  - Wrapper skill exists at .orqa/process/skills/code-search/SKILL.md
  - "Documents context detection logic (check for mcp__chunkhound__* vs search_regex availability)"
  - Instructs agent to load chunkhound (CLI) or orqa-native-search (App) based on detection
  - Shared query patterns documented (same as both underlying skills)

## What

Create the `code-search` wrapper skill that detects runtime context (CLI vs App) and
instructs the agent to load the appropriate concrete skill.

## Implementation Notes

The wrapper skill SKILL.md should:
1. Explain the two contexts and how to detect them
2. Provide the shared query patterns (identical across both implementations)
3. Instruct: "If `mcp__chunkhound__*` tools are available, you are in CLI context — follow
   ChunkHound patterns. If `search_regex`/`search_semantic` are Tauri commands, you are in
   App context — follow native search patterns."
4. Link to both concrete skills for implementation-specific details

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
