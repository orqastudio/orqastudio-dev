title: File-first data alignment audit
description: Audit all persistent data to ensure clear file-vs-database justification. Files are the source of truth for governance artifacts; the database is a derived index rebuilt on scan. Verify no governance data is database-only.

research-needed:
  - "Which database tables duplicate file-based data?"
  - "Can the artifacts table be treated as a pure scan cache?"
  - "Should governance_analyses be exportable as artifacts?"

## Context

OrqaStudio stores governance artifacts as markdown files in `.orqa/` and also
indexes them in SQLite (`artifacts` table). The file is the source of truth;
the database is a read-optimized derived view.

Need to verify this principle holds everywhere and no governance data exists
only in the database without a file-based representation.

## Tables That Are Correctly Database-Only

- `sessions` + `messages` — runtime conversation state, not artifacts
- `settings` — app preferences, not governance
- `enforcement_violations` — runtime event log (though could be promoted to lessons)
- `governance_analyses` + `recommendations` — AI-generated, tied to sessions

## Tables That Should Be Verified

- `artifacts` — should be a pure scan cache, never the source of truth
- `project_themes` — derived from design files, should be rebuildable
