## What

Three new governance rules:
- **[RULE-c95f4444](RULE-c95f4444) (data persistence)**: Documents which data belongs in SQLite vs
  file-based artifacts vs ephemeral state
- **[RULE-f9d0279c](RULE-f9d0279c) (skill injection)**: Documents the automated skill injection
  system — when skills are injected, deduplication, path-to-skill mapping
- **[RULE-7f416d7d](RULE-7f416d7d) (tooling ecosystem)**: Documents that OrqaStudio manages linter
  config to match documented standards, not replicate linter functionality

## How

1. Create `.orqa/process/rules/[RULE-c95f4444](RULE-c95f4444).md` with proper frontmatter
2. Create `.orqa/process/rules/[RULE-f9d0279c](RULE-f9d0279c).md` with proper frontmatter
3. Create `.orqa/process/rules/[RULE-7f416d7d](RULE-7f416d7d).md` with proper frontmatter
4. Follow existing rule format (schema-compliant frontmatter, body sections)

## Verification

- All three rules pass schema validation
- Each rule has clear enforcement entries where applicable
- Rules reference each other and related rules appropriately
