## Implementation Design

### Native Tool UX
- Friendly names for tool types: Read → "Reading file", Bash → "Running command"
- Lucide icons per tool type
- Parameter extraction for summary display
- Consecutive call de-duplication ("Read 3 files")
- Collapsible detail view

### First-Run Setup Wizard
- Claude CLI detection (binary on PATH)
- Auth status verification
- Project configuration (name, icon, model)
- Custom project icon upload via Tauri dialog plugin
- Settings decomposition into focused sub-components

## Git Evidence

- `5156a6e` — CLI version and auth status
- `34ec185` — Custom project icon
- `1193abb` — File-based project settings
