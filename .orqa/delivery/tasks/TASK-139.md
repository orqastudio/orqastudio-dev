acceptance:
  - Every .svelte file under ui/src/lib/components/ catalogued with purpose
  - RULE-cb65b5d0 inventory reflects actual disk state
  - Name mismatches resolved (rule uses actual component names)
  - Components in wrong locations identified with recommended moves
  - Follow-up tasks created for missing-but-useful components

## What

Audit all `.svelte` components under `ui/src/lib/components/` to produce a complete inventory of reusable/shared components. Map each against [RULE-cb65b5d0](RULE-cb65b5d0)'s current 12-item list. Identify:

1. Components that exist but under different names (e.g., StatusBadge = StatusIndicator)
2. Components that exist but in the wrong location (e.g., CodeBlock exists but not in `shared/`)
3. Components that don't exist but would be useful to create
4. Components that exist in shared/ but aren't in the rule

Update [RULE-cb65b5d0](RULE-cb65b5d0) with the accurate inventory. For components that should exist but don't, create follow-up tasks.

## How

1. Glob all `.svelte` files under `ui/src/lib/components/` and record their paths and purposes
2. Compare each against the 12 entries in [RULE-cb65b5d0](RULE-cb65b5d0)'s shared component table
3. Categorise findings: matches, name mismatches, wrong location, missing from rule, useful-but-missing
4. Edit [RULE-cb65b5d0](RULE-cb65b5d0) to replace the table with the accurate inventory
5. Create TASK-NNN follow-up artifacts for any missing components worth building

## Verification

- [ ] Every .svelte file under ui/src/lib/components/ catalogued with purpose
- [ ] [RULE-cb65b5d0](RULE-cb65b5d0) inventory reflects actual disk state
- [ ] Name mismatches resolved (rule uses actual component names)
- [ ] Components in wrong locations identified with recommended moves
- [ ] Follow-up tasks created for missing-but-useful components
