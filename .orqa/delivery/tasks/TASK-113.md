## What

Catalogued all reusable shared UI components with their props, variants, states, and composition patterns.

## How

Listed every component in the shared library, defined the props interface and variant options for each, enumerated all component states (loading, empty, error, loaded), and documented how components compose together in page templates.

## Verification

Component inventory is complete, each shared component has defined variants and all states documented, and composition patterns are captured for page-level assembly.
