## What

End-to-end verification that the reorganised repository works correctly.

## How

1. `make check` — all linting, type checking, tests
2. `make dev` — verify Vite + Tauri start, dashboard works
3. `make kill`
4. `make build` — production build succeeds
5. Search for any remaining stale path references

## Verification

- [ ] `make check` passes
- [ ] `make dev` + `make kill` cycle works
- [ ] `make build` succeeds
- [ ] No stale paths found via grep
