title: Task-First Audit Trail with Optional Epics
description: "All work that modifies files requires a task for audit trail. Whether epic linkage is required or optional is a project config setting (`epics-required`), set during project setup. Implementation-heavy projects enforce epic linkage; research/planning projects make it optional. Traceability is maintained either way."

## Decision

The task artifact becomes the universal unit of work. **All work that modifies files
must have a task.** Whether epic linkage is required or optional is a **project
configuration setting** — `epics-required` in `project.json`.

### Before

```
Task → Epic (required, hardcoded) → Milestone (required on epic)
```

Every task needed an epic, regardless of project type. This created friction for
ad-hoc work, quick fixes, and non-software domains where strategic grouping
emerges bottom-up.

### After

```
Task (required for all file-modifying work — audit trail)
  ↓ configured per project
Epic (groups related tasks — strategic context)
  ↓ required on epic
Milestone (delivery target)
```

### Project Configuration

The `epics-required` setting in `project.json` controls epic enforcement:

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "epics-required": true
  }
}
```

| Setting | Behavior | Best For |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `epics-required: true` | Tasks MUST have an `epic` field. Enforcement blocks code writes without epic linkage. | Software projects, implementation-heavy work |
| `epics-required: false` | Tasks MAY have an `epic` field. Enforcement warns but does not block. | Research projects, planning, personal use, ad-hoc work |

**Default**: `true` — new software projects enforce epic linkage by default. The
project setup wizard offers this as a choice based on project type inference.

### Project Setup Integration

During `project-setup`, the setup skill infers the project type and sets the default:

| Inferred Project Type | Default Setting |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Software (has `src/`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`) | `epics-required: true` |
| Research / documentation | `epics-required: false` |
| Planning / personal | `epics-required: false` |
| Mixed / unclear | Ask user during setup |

The user can override during setup or change the setting later in `project.json`.

### Enforcement

The enforcement engine and plugin enforce task-first via tool hooks. The epic
enforcement level depends on the `epics-required` setting:

| Agent Action | Task Exists? | `epics-required: true` | `epics-required: false` |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Read / Search | Don't care | No enforcement | No enforcement |
| Write/Edit `.orqa/` files | No active task | **Warn**: "Create a task for audit trail." | **Warn**: "Create a task for audit trail." |
| Write/Edit source code | No active task | **Block**: "Create TASK-NNN first." | **Block**: "Create TASK-NNN first." |
| Write/Edit source code | Task exists, no epic | **Block**: "Link to an epic first." | **Warn**: "Consider linking to an epic." |

### Schema Change

The `epic` field on tasks changes from always-required to conditionally-required:

```json
// In schema.json: epic is always in properties, never in "required"
// Enforcement of epic presence is handled by the enforcement engine
// reading the project.json workflow.epics-required setting, not by
// JSON Schema validation.
```

The schema validation layer treats `epic` as optional. The enforcement layer
applies the project config to determine whether its absence is a warning or block.

### What the Task Provides (Audit Trail)

Every task records:
- **What**: `title`, `description`, `scope`
- **Why**: `acceptance` criteria, optional `epic` reference for strategic context
- **How**: `docs` (documentation loaded), `skills` (skills loaded)
- **When**: `created`, `updated`, status transitions
- **Dependencies**: `depends-on` for ordering

This is a complete audit trail regardless of whether an epic exists.

### Domain Implications

| Domain | Typical Setting | Typical Pattern |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Software project** | `epics-required: true` | Epics planned upfront → tasks under epics → top-down |
| **Research project** | `epics-required: false` | Tasks as work happens → epics emerge when patterns form → bottom-up |
| **Personal planning** | `epics-required: false` | Standalone tasks → epics optional for major goals |
| **Marketing campaign** | `epics-required: true` | Campaign epics planned upfront, ad-hoc tasks also get epic links |

The `epics-required` setting is chosen during project setup based on project type
inference and can be changed at any time. The audit trail (task artifact) exists
regardless of the setting.

### Orphan Task Management

When `epics-required: false`, tasks without epics are visible in the artifact
graph as orphan nodes. The governance maintenance process can:

1. Surface orphan tasks during periodic reviews
2. Suggest epic groupings based on scope/topic similarity
3. Leave them standalone if they're genuinely independent work

Orphan tasks are NOT a violation when the project allows them — they're a valid
state for ad-hoc work. When `epics-required: true`, orphan tasks are blocked by
enforcement before they can be created.

## Rationale

1. **Audit trail is the primary value**: The task records what was done, why, and
   what changed. This is valuable regardless of epic grouping.

2. **Domain agnosticism via config**: Non-software domains (research, planning,
   marketing) often work bottom-up. Making epic enforcement a project config
   setting lets each project choose its level of structure without weakening it
   for projects that need it.

3. **Right-sized ceremony**: Software projects keep mandatory epic linkage.
   Research and planning projects can opt out. The setting is chosen during
   project setup — not an afterthought.

4. **Graph integrity**: Tasks still participate in the graph via `docs`, `skills`,
   `depends-on` edges. The epic edge is just one of many relationships — making it
   optional doesn't break graph traversal.

5. **Enforcement shift**: The enforcement focus moves from "does this task have an
   epic?" (structural) to "does this work have a task?" (audit trail). The latter
   is more valuable.

## Consequences

### Positive

- All file-modifying work produces an audit trail (task artifact)
- Epic enforcement is configurable per project, not one-size-fits-all
- Software projects keep full structure; research projects get less ceremony
- Project setup wizard sets the right default based on project type inference
- Graph traversal still works — `task.docs` and `task.skills` don't need epics

### Negative

- When `epics-required: false`, orphan tasks may accumulate without governance review
- [RULE-7b770593](RULE-7b770593) (artifact lifecycle) needs updating to respect the project config
- Enforcement engine must read `project.json` to determine epic enforcement level
- Project setup skill needs updating to include the `workflow.epics-required` choice

### Risks

- **Orphan proliferation** (when `epics-required: false`): Projects may accumulate
  many standalone tasks. Mitigated by governance reviews and plugin warnings.
- **Strategic drift** (when `epics-required: false`): Work without epic context may
  not align with pillars. Mitigated by the orchestrator asking "which pillar does
  this serve?" for standalone tasks.
- **Config not set**: Old projects without `workflow.epics-required` in config.
  Mitigated by defaulting to `true` when the setting is absent.

### Migration

- Update task schema: `epic` moves from required to optional (schema validation)
- Add `workflow.epics-required` to `project.json` schema
- Update [RULE-7b770593](RULE-7b770593): Epic enforcement reads project config instead of hardcoding
- Update [RULE-8035e176](RULE-8035e176): "Structure before work" minimum is "task" when `epics-required: false`
- Update project-setup skill: Include `epics-required` in setup wizard
- Backfill: No migration needed — all existing tasks have epics and remain valid
- Default: Projects without the setting default to `epics-required: true`
