## What

[RES-9bcc7279](RES-9bcc7279) found [TASK-21b461ea](TASK-21b461ea) (AI search) marked done but implementation is client-side text search only, not AI-driven. [TASK-db9be55f](TASK-db9be55f) (README audit) was never started.

## How

1. Update [TASK-21b461ea](TASK-21b461ea) status to `in-progress`, add note about current state
2. Verify [TASK-db9be55f](TASK-db9be55f) is `todo`
3. Update [EPIC-6787bb93](EPIC-6787bb93) description to reflect ~65% completion

## Verification

Task statuses match reality. No false "done" claims.
