acceptance:
  - "Documentation section in nav shows top-level doc categories (Architecture, Product, Development, Process, UI, Guide, etc.) not status values"
  - "Navigation component for doc-type artifacts groups by directory structure, not by status field"
  - Each category shows its README icon and label if available
  - Clicking a category expands to show the pages within it

    rationale: Category-based nav matches how users think about documentation

## Scope

Update the navigation component for doc-type artifacts to display top-level directory categories rather than status-based grouping.
