title: Acceptance criteria not verified line-by-line after implementation
description: Implementer agents deliver the structural change but miss specific acceptance criteria items. The orchestrator marks tasks done without checking each criterion against the actual output. UAT then catches items that were in scope but not delivered.

## Pattern

Under task volume, the orchestrator:
1. Delegates a task with acceptance criteria to an implementer
2. The implementer returns a summary of what was done
3. The orchestrator marks the task done based on the summary
4. UAT later reveals specific acceptance criteria that were not met

Examples from EPIC-b2ca1ea3 UAT round 3:
- TASK-d8a69e21 acceptance: "Roadmap should be first item in Delivery" — roadmap remained top-level (F41)
- TASK-e40d6994 acceptance: "Column grouping/sorting configurable" — no sort dropdown exists (F38)
- TASK-ebc48b97 acceptance: "Relationships no longer appear in metadata card" — relationship-specific fields (epic, milestone, depends-on) still show (F44)

## Root Cause

The orchestrator trusts the implementer's completion summary without independently verifying each acceptance criterion. RULE-303c1cc8 requires an independent reviewer, but under volume pressure this step gets compressed to "did the agent say it was done?" rather than "did I check each criterion?"

## Fix

After each implementation task, the orchestrator must read the task's `acceptance` field and verify each item independently — not by re-reading the agent's output, but by checking the actual result (reading the changed files, testing the behavior). If an acceptance criterion can't be verified from the orchestrator's context, delegate verification to a reviewer agent with the specific criteria to check.
