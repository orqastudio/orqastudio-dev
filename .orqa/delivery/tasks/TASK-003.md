## What

Update `.orqa/documentation/development/streaming-pipeline.md` to reflect the new `SystemPromptSent` emission point added by [TASK-58a9d218](TASK-58a9d218).

## Sections to Update

1. **Event sequence diagram** — Add `SystemPromptSent` between system prompt resolution and sidecar send
2. **StreamEvent variants table** — Ensure `SystemPromptSent` and `ContextInjected` are listed with their fields
3. **Emission points section** — Document where and when `SystemPromptSent` is emitted
4. **Future work notes** — Note that `custom_prompt` [EPIC-642234ba](EPIC-642234ba) and `ContextInjected` [EPIC-1dcf5ffa](EPIC-1dcf5ffa) extend this

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
