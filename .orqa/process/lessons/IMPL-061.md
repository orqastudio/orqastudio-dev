## Pattern

The pipeline health widget shows auto-fix results as a persistent green banner inside the card. This takes space, doesn't auto-dismiss, and clutters the "all clear" state. The confirmation is a transient event — it happened, the user saw it, it should go away.

## Fix

Implement a toast notification system. Transient confirmations (fix applied, scan complete, settings saved) go to toast. Persistent state (errors found, action needed) stays inline in the relevant widget.
