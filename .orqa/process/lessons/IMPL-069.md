title: Artifacts mentioned in body text should have matching relationships
description: "When an artifact ID appears in body text (e.g., EPIC-be023ed2 referenced in a task description), there should be a corresponding relationship in the frontmatter. Body text references without graph edges are invisible to traversal."

## Pattern

Artifacts reference other artifacts by ID in their body text but don't declare relationships in frontmatter. The graph can't traverse these connections — they're invisible to analysis, health checks, and the artifact graph visualization.

## Fix

The graph-guardian PostToolUse hook should detect artifact IDs in body text and warn when no corresponding relationship exists. The integrity scanner should flag body-text references without matching relationships.
