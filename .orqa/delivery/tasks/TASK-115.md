## What

Designed the SQLite schema for conversation persistence covering sessions, messages, tool calls, and metrics tables with indexes and foreign key constraints.

## How

Defined each table's columns with types, NOT NULL constraints, and defaults, added indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns, and documented cascade delete rules and the migration strategy.

## Verification

Schema design covers all conversation persistence needs, indexes align with IPC command access patterns, and the migration approach is documented.
