## What

Add `make verify-links`, `make verify-integrity`, and `make verify` targets to the Makefile.

## How

1. Add targets to Makefile calling the corresponding tools scripts
2. Update `.orqa/documentation/development/commands.md` with the new targets
3. Update [RULE-c71f1c3f](RULE-c71f1c3f) command mapping table

## Verification

- `make verify-links` runs and reports results
- `make verify-integrity` runs and reports results
- `make verify` runs both
