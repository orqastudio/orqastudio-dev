## Context

UAT round 3 collected 30 findings across the app after implementing 31 tasks in 6 epics. F2 (agent artifact discipline — 57 integrity warnings) was addressed by EPIC-064 (enforcement bootstrapping). The remaining 29 findings group into 10 systemic themes.

## UAT Findings

| # | Finding | Type | Area | Theme |
|---|---------|------|------|-------|

| F37 | Drag and drop between roadmap kanban columns not working | bug | roadmap | Roadmap |

| F39 | Column headers: remove "X items", move "X/X done" into that spot, capitalize words, put in badge | ux | roadmap | Roadmap |
| F40 | Progress bar circles on milestone cards not centered on label | ux | roadmap | Roadmap |
| F41 | Roadmap still top-level nav — should be inside Delivery section as first item | bug | navigation | Navigation |
| F42 | Relationship graph needs proper library (zoom, pan, dynamic layout, click-to-navigate) | ux | artifact-viewer | Graph viz |
| F43 | Metadata panel: add icons to all fields (only scoring has one) | ux | artifact-viewer | Viewer layout |
| F44 | Metadata panel still shows relationship-specific fields (epic, milestone, depends-on) duplicating relationships list | bug | artifact-viewer | Viewer layout |
| F45 | Gap between metadata panel and acceptance criteria too large | ux | artifact-viewer | Viewer layout |
| F46 | No gap between acceptance criteria and body content on tasks | ux | artifact-viewer | Viewer layout |
| F47 | Artifact link display mode (ID vs title) should be per-type, not just global | ux | settings | Artifact links |

## Systemic Analysis

### Theme 1: Navigation Architecture (F17-F24)
**Root cause**: The nav structure was built incrementally and doesn't match the conceptual model of Exploring (divergent thinking) vs Delivery (convergent execution).

**Fix**: Restructure main nav into 4 sections: Exploring → Delivery → Documentation → Process. Exploring gets ideas + research. Delivery gets roadmap (top), milestones, epics, tasks. Remove or repurpose Verification. Fix missing icons.

### Theme 2: Artifact Link System (F6-F10, F27, F28)
**Root cause**: The ArtifactLink component was built for basic rendering. Now it needs to be a rich, configurable, interactive element with status dots inside, per-type colours, hover popovers, display mode settings, and proper text overflow.

**Fix**: Systematic rework of ArtifactLink component + project settings for colour/display configuration. Also fix relationships leaking into metadata card.

### Theme 3: Roadmap View (F4, F5)
**Root cause**: Roadmap kanban is a flat view. The conceptual model is hierarchical: Now/Next/Later → milestones → epics → tasks.

**Fix**: Build drill-down navigation with breadcrumbs, collapsible done columns, drag-drop between columns, and configurable grouping/sorting. This is a substantial UX feature.

### Theme 4: Schema/Data Fixes (F12, F14, F15)
**Root cause**: Legacy frontmatter fields (scope on rules/skills) that should be relationship types. Status vocabulary mismatch on lessons.

**Fix**: Migrate scope fields to scoped-to/scoped-by relationships. Fix lesson status vocabulary. Update schemas.

### Theme 5: Dashboard Polish (F1, F30, F32, F33)
**Root cause**: Dashboard components built quickly without using shared component library.

**Fix**: Replace native elements with shared components (ScrollArea, SelectMenu, proper filter toggles). F1 (holistic redesign) is a larger piece — defer to separate research/epic.

### Theme 6: Artifact Viewer Layout (F11, F13)
**Root cause**: Minor layout issues in artifact viewer.

**Fix**: Move actions below status pipeline. Fix connector line vertical centering.

### Theme 7: Documentation Reorganisation (F25, F26)
**Root cause**: Docs grew organically without structure. Needs research ([RES-063](RES-063)) then its own epic.

**Fix**: Research doc-chapter structure, plan migration, create epic. Remove redundant category badge.

### Theme 8: UI Polish (F31)
**Root cause**: Toast notification defaults not customised.

**Fix**: Configure toast position, animation, min-width.

### Theme 9: Settings (F29)
**Root cause**: Keyboard shortcut exists but isn't registered in config UI.

**Fix**: Add Ctrl+Space to keyboard shortcuts section.

### Theme 10: Quick Fixes (F3, F16)
**Root cause**: Individual bugs.

**Fix**: Fix broken link. Fix IDEA-095 categorisation.

## Verification

All findings re-tested after implementation. Each theme verified independently.

## Deferred with User Awareness

- F1 (dashboard holistic redesign) — research created ([RES-064](RES-064)), needs its own epic after research is complete
- F2 (agent artifact discipline) — addressed by EPIC-064
- IDEA-096 (exploration whiteboard) — captured as idea, not in scope for implementation
