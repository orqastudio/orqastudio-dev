## What

Create [RULE-130f1f63](RULE-130f1f63) codifying the data integrity requirements established in Phase 0.

## How

1. Create `.orqa/process/rules/[RULE-130f1f63](RULE-130f1f63).md` with frontmatter and body
2. Cover all integrity requirements: link resolution, bidirectional inverses, enforcement mechanisms
3. Reference related rules (RULE-a764b2ae, [RULE-2f7b6a31](RULE-2f7b6a31), RULE-633e636d)

## Verification

- [RULE-130f1f63](RULE-130f1f63) exists and passes schema validation
- Rule content accurately reflects the enforcement implemented in [TASK-e7324438](TASK-e7324438)/282
