## What

Established the visual design system covering typography, colour palette, spacing scale, and iconography conventions for OrqaStudio.

## How

Defined theme tokens mapped to Tailwind CSS configuration, adopted Lucide as the sole icon library, and documented the conventions in the UI design documentation.

## Verification

Design system documentation exists and all tokens resolve to Tailwind configuration values with no orphaned or undefined tokens.
