# Claude Code Connector Comprehensive Review

## The Idea

Conduct a thorough review of the claude-code connector to assess its current state, identify gaps, and plan improvements. The connector bridges OrqaStudio's artifact graph with Claude Code's CLI-based AI assistance, but it has grown organically and may have inconsistencies, missing capabilities, or outdated patterns.

## Review Scope

- **Skill coverage** — are all relevant platform skills exposed to Claude Code? Are any stale or missing?
- **Context injection** — does the connector provide Claude Code with the right context (project structure, active artifacts, relevant rules) without overwhelming the context window?
- **Tool integration** — does the connector properly expose OrqaStudio's IPC commands as tools Claude Code can call?
- **Error handling** — how does the connector handle failures (IPC timeout, malformed responses, missing artifacts)?
- **Performance** — is context loading fast enough for interactive use? Are there unnecessary round-trips?
- **Security** — does the connector properly scope what Claude Code can read/write? Are there any privilege escalation paths?
