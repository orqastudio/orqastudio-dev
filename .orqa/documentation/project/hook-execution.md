# Hook Execution Semantics

OrqaStudio governance hooks run inside Claude Code sessions via the claude-code-connector
plugin. Hooks intercept Claude Code lifecycle events, evaluate governance rules, inject
knowledge, and optionally block tool calls. This document defines when hooks fire, how
they execute, and what happens when they return results.

The hook scripts live in `connectors/claude-code/hooks/scripts/`. The registration file
is `connectors/claude-code/hooks/hooks.json`.

## Hook Lifecycle

Each event fires exactly once at the described point in the session lifecycle.

### `SessionStart`

Fires once per session, before any user interaction begins. The session guard
(`tmp/.session-started`) prevents it from running more than once even if the hook
system retries.

**What it does in OrqaStudio:**

- Runs `orqa validate --fix` to auto-repair missing relationship inverses
- Checks for git stashes, stale worktrees, and uncommitted changes on main
- Loads `tmp/session-state.md` to inject the previous session's context
- Loads `tmp/governance-context.md` if saved before the previous compaction
- Detects dogfood mode (`"dogfood": true` in `.orqa/project.json`)
- Outputs the session protocol checklist and orchestrator reminders

**Script:** `session-start.sh`

### `UserPromptSubmit`

Fires when the user sends a message, before Claude processes it.

**What it does in OrqaStudio:**

- Reads the user's prompt
- Classifies intent against governance operation categories
- Injects relevant knowledge into context based on what the prompt is about

**Script:** `prompt-injector.mjs`

### `PreToolUse`

Fires before a tool executes. This is the only event that can block tool calls.
The tool will NOT execute if a hook returns a deny decision.

**What it does in OrqaStudio (Write, Edit, Bash):**

- Loads all active rules from `.orqa/process/rules/RULE-*.md` that have an
  `enforcement` array in their frontmatter
- Evaluates each enforcement entry against the tool call (file path, content,
  or command string)
- If any entry matches with `action: block` — denies the tool call
- If any entry matches with `action: warn` — allows the tool call, appends warning
- If any entry matches with `action: inject` — injects knowledge into context (once per session)

**Script:** `rule-engine.mjs`

### `PostToolUse`

Fires after a tool executes. Cannot block tools — the tool has already run.

**What it does in OrqaStudio (Write, Edit):**

- Validates `.orqa/` files written or edited against their schema
- Reports frontmatter errors as warnings without blocking subsequent tool calls

**What it does in OrqaStudio (Bash):**

- Validates bash commands for safety patterns after they have run
- Can warn about patterns that were not caught by PreToolUse (rare)

**Scripts:** `validate-artifact.mjs`, `bash-safety.mjs`

### `SubagentStop`

Fires when a subagent completes its work and returns control to the orchestrator.

**What it does in OrqaStudio:**

- Reads the subagent's output summary
- Validates that the output falls within the governance scope of the original task
- Warns the orchestrator if the subagent appears to have exceeded its role boundary

**Script:** `subagent-review.mjs`

### `PreCompact`

Fires before Claude Code compacts the conversation context to stay within token limits.

**What it does in OrqaStudio:**

- Saves the current governance context (active epic, tasks, scope) to
  `tmp/governance-context.md`
- This file is loaded by the next `SessionStart` hook to restore context after compaction

**Script:** `save-context.mjs`

### `Stop`

Fires when the session ends — when the user closes the session or Claude stops responding.

**What it does in OrqaStudio:**

- Checks for uncommitted changes that should be committed before the session ends
- Outputs a pre-commit checklist reminder

**Script:** `stop-checklist.sh`

## Execution Ordering

Multiple hooks registered for the same event execute sequentially in the order they
appear in `hooks.json`. For `PreToolUse`, which has both a `Write|Edit` matcher and a
`Bash` matcher, only the matching hooks run — Claude Code evaluates the `matcher` regex
against the tool name before invoking any scripts.

Within a single matcher, hooks execute in array order. If the first hook blocks,
subsequent hooks for the same event still run (they receive the same input) but their
output is ignored if the tool is already denied.

## Error Handling

Hook failures do not block the tool call unless the hook explicitly returns a deny decision.

| Failure Mode | Behaviour |
|-------------|-----------|
| Hook timeout (default 10s) | Tool proceeds as if hook returned allow (no output) |
| Hook exits with non-zero code | Tool proceeds as if hook returned allow; stderr output is discarded |
| Hook returns invalid JSON | Treated as allow; malformed output is ignored |
| Hook script file not found | Tool proceeds silently; missing scripts are not an error |

The timeout for each hook is configured per-entry in `hooks.json`. The
`connectors/claude-code/hooks/hooks.json` uses 10s for most hooks and 15s for
`SessionStart` and `SubagentStop`, which do more IO.

## Result Merging

When multiple hooks fire for the same event and return output:

- **`systemMessage` values are concatenated** with newline separators in registration order
- **Block/deny overrides allow**: if any hook for a `PreToolUse` event returns
  `permissionDecision: "deny"`, the tool is blocked regardless of what other hooks return
- **Precedence**: `deny` > `warn` (systemMessage with no deny) > `allow` (no output)
- **Knowledge injection deduplication**: the rule engine tracks which knowledge artifacts
  have been injected this session in `tmp/.injected-skills.json`. A second Write to a
  different file in the same domain does not re-inject the same knowledge.

### Hook Output Format

Hooks communicate with Claude Code via stdout (non-blocking) or stderr + exit code 2
(blocking). The output must be JSON.

**Non-blocking result (warn or inject):**

```json
{
  "systemMessage": "Warning text or injected knowledge content"
}
```

Output to stdout. Exit code 0.

**Blocking result (deny):**

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "permissionDecision": "deny"
  },
  "systemMessage": "Explanation of why the tool call was denied"
}
```

Output to stderr. Exit code 2.

**Allow (no action):**

No output. Exit code 0.

## Hook-to-Rule Mapping

Enforcement entries in `.orqa/process/rules/RULE-*.md` declare which hook event evaluates
them. The rule engine (`rule-engine.mjs`) reads all active rules and evaluates only the
entries matching the current event.

```yaml
# In a RULE-*.md frontmatter:
enforcement:
  - event: file          # Evaluated by PreToolUse (Write/Edit tool calls)
    pattern: "unwrap\\(\\)"
    paths: ["src-tauri/src/**/*.rs"]
    action: block
    message: "No unwrap() in production Rust code (RULE-b49142be)."

  - event: bash          # Evaluated by PreToolUse (Bash tool calls)
    pattern: "--no-verify"
    action: block
    message: "Never bypass pre-commit hooks."

  - event: inject        # Evaluated by PreToolUse — non-blocking knowledge injection
    paths: ["ui/src/lib/stores/**/*.ts"]
    action: inject
    knowledge: ["orqa-store-patterns"]
    message: "Store patterns injected."
```

The `event` field values map to hook events as follows:

| `event` value | Hook event | Tool matcher |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| `file` | `PreToolUse` | `Write\|Edit` |
| `bash` | `PreToolUse` | `Bash` |
| `inject` | `PreToolUse` | `Write\|Edit` |
| `lint` | (declarative) | Not executed — documents linter delegation |

`lint` entries are never executed. They exist in rule frontmatter purely as traceability
markers documenting which linter rule enforces which standard. See
`connectors/claude-code/knowledge/rule-enforcement/KNOW.md` for details.

## Adding New Hooks

### Step 1: Write the hook script

Create a new script in `connectors/claude-code/hooks/scripts/`. Scripts must:

- Read hook input from stdin as JSON
- Write JSON output to stdout (non-blocking) or stderr (blocking, exit 2)
- Exit 0 for allow/warn, exit 2 for deny
- Handle malformed stdin gracefully (parse errors → exit 0)
- Complete within the configured timeout

**Hook input schema (stdin):**

```json
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "tool_name": "string",
  "tool_input": {},
  "cwd": "string"
}
```

For `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, and `Stop`,
the `tool_name` and `tool_input` fields are absent or empty. These hooks receive
session-level context only.

### Step 2: Register in hooks.json

Add an entry to `connectors/claude-code/hooks/hooks.json` under the correct event key:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/your-script.mjs",
            "timeout": 10000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Available event keys: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionStart`,
`SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `Stop`.

The `matcher` field is a regex matched against the tool name for `PreToolUse` and
`PostToolUse`. Use `"*"` for events that have no tool context.

The `timeout` is in milliseconds. Default 10000 (10s). Use 15000 for hooks that do
significant IO (file scanning, git operations).

### Step 3: Declare in orqa-plugin.json

Add a hooks entry to `connectors/claude-code/orqa-plugin.json` so the plugin manifest
documents the hook:

```json
{
  "provides": {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "event": "PreToolUse",
        "description": "Brief description of what this hook enforces"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Link to the governing rule (if applicable)

If the hook enforces a governance rule, add an `enforcement` entry to the rule's
frontmatter with the appropriate `event` value. This creates the traceability chain:

```
Rule document → enforcement entry → hook script → tool call decision
```

## Telemetry

All hook scripts call `logTelemetry()` from `telemetry.mjs` to record execution results
to `tmp/hook-telemetry.jsonl`. Each line is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "hook": "rule-engine",
  "event": "PreToolUse",
  "duration_ms": 12,
  "result": "blocked",
  "data": { "tool": "Write", "violations_found": 1, "blocked_rules": ["RULE-b49142be"] },
  "timestamp": "2026-03-20T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The telemetry file is gitignored and reset each session. Use it for debugging hook
performance or enforcement gaps.
