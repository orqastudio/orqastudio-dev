## What

A Spotlight-style floating search overlay that provides AI-driven cross-artifact search without losing the user's current browsing context.

## How

1. Create `ArtifactSearchOverlay.svelte` in `ui/src/lib/components/navigation/`
2. Use shadcn Dialog or a custom overlay with backdrop blur and dimming
3. Register global keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Space) via a Svelte action or window event listener
4. On query submit, build a system prompt with artifact graph summary (types, counts, statuses, key references)
5. Send to AI provider via existing streaming infrastructure or a dedicated search command
6. Parse the AI response for artifact IDs and render as a results list
7. Add SearchIcon button to ActivityBar bottom section above Settings

## Verification

- [ ] `make typecheck` passes
- [ ] Ctrl+Space opens and closes the overlay
- [ ] Search input receives focus immediately on open
- [ ] AI search returns relevant artifacts for test queries
- [ ] Selecting a result navigates correctly
