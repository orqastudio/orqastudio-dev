## What

Read each doc listed in scope. Apply the 5 audit criteria from the plan.
Fix misalignment in-place.

## Priority Order

1. `architecture/decisions.md` — foundational, referenced by many rules
2. `architecture/project-configuration.md` — directly affected by config changes
3. `process/orchestration.md` — defines how the orchestrator works
4. `process/artifact-workflow.md` — defines artifact lifecycle
5. Everything else

## Deliverable

Updated markdown files with a summary of changes made per file.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification
