# AD-064: Inference-Time Decision Tree — Self-Navigating Knowledge Discovery

## Context

The current knowledge injection model pre-injects domain knowledge into agents via the `UserPromptSubmit` hook. This has three problems:

1. **Wasted context** — irrelevant knowledge consumes tokens (the INTENT_MAP guesses what's relevant)
2. **No reasoning visibility** — the user can't see WHY certain knowledge was injected
3. **Static** — injection rules are hardcoded in hook scripts, not adaptable to novel prompts

The idea (IDEA-a3f2c17e) proposes a fundamentally different model: instead of injecting knowledge AT agents, inject a **reasoning protocol** that teaches agents HOW to find knowledge themselves.

## Decision

### 1. Replace pre-injection with a reasoning protocol

The `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects a concise decision tree (NOT knowledge content). The agent works through the tree as part of its inference, using `search_semantic` and file reads to load what it determines it needs.

### 2. The decision tree is a governance artifact

A structured markdown file in `.orqa/process/knowledge/` that defines the questions agents should ask themselves. It is editable, versionable, and inspectable in the app.

### 3. Plugin-extensible branches

Plugins add branches to the decision tree via their manifest. The software plugin adds implementation sub-branches (UI, Rust, Store). The tree merges at install time.

### 4. Three-level classification

- **Level 1 — Intent**: research / implementation / feedback / planning / review
- **Level 2 — Domain**: frontend / backend / governance / store / infrastructure
- **Level 3 — Specific knowledge**: READ: svelte5-best-practices, orqa-ipc-patterns, etc.

### 5. Embeddings-enhanced but not dependent

When the search server is available, Level 1 classification uses semantic similarity against pre-computed category embeddings. Without it, the agent's own reasoning suffices. Graceful degradation.

### 6. Agent-specific trees

Different agents can have different decision trees (orchestrator focuses on delegation, implementer focuses on domain selection, reviewer focuses on standards). The base tree is shared; agents extend with role-specific questions.

## Impact

- Rewrite `prompt-injector.mjs` — inject decision tree instead of knowledge
- Create decision tree governance artifact in `.orqa/process/knowledge/`
- Update CLAUDE.md and agent definitions to reference the tree
- Remove INTENT_MAP (replaced by the tree and semantic search)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep pre-injection, improve the INTENT_MAP** — rejected: the fundamental problem is guessing at injection time. A better guess is still a guess. The tree model removes the guess entirely.
2. **No injection at all** — rejected: agents without structured reasoning prompts make inconsistent decisions about which knowledge to load. The tree provides reproducible behaviour.
3. **Embed knowledge summaries in the tree** — rejected: this recreates the token waste problem. The tree must reference knowledge by path only, not include content.

## Risks

- **Tree maintenance burden** — the tree must stay current as knowledge files are added/removed. Mitigated by: validation that every leaf points to a real file, and the same install-time merge mechanism used for all plugin schemas.
- **Agent deviation** — agents may ignore the tree or navigate it inconsistently. Mitigated by: the tree is injected as a mandatory pre-reasoning step, and thinking blocks show navigation for inspection.
- **Plugin branch conflicts** — two plugins adding branches for the same domain. Mitigated by: merge strategy documented in the tree schema, with explicit conflict resolution rules.

## Related Decisions

- AD-063 (relationship schema) — the decision tree artifact employs the `employs` relationship to connect agents to knowledge, consistent with the relationship model defined in AD-063
