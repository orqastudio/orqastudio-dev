## What

Research documents often reference external sources (library docs, GitHub issues, blog posts, specifications). Currently these are just inline markdown links in the body. Adding a structured `sources` field to frontmatter makes them graph-queryable — the system can trace which external knowledge informed which decisions.

## How

1. Add `sources` array to `.orqa/delivery/research/schema.json`
2. Each source has required `url` and `description`, optional `tier` (T1-T4)
3. Update artifact-framework.md Research schema section

## Verification

- Research schema accepts sources array with url, description, tier
- Existing research docs without sources still validate
- Artifact framework docs updated with sources field
