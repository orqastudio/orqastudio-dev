## What

Content audit of all 44 rules for alignment with the knowledge maturity pipeline philosophy.

## How

1. Read each rule
2. Check: deprecated field references in body text → fix
3. Check: methodology content that belongs in skills → flag for extraction
4. Check: Related Rules section matches relationships array → align
5. Check: relationship rationales are meaningful → improve where generic
6. Absorb any operational standards from documentation/ that should be rules

## Verification

- Every rule passes content review checklist
- No deprecated references remain in rule body text
- Related Rules sections are consistent with relationships arrays
