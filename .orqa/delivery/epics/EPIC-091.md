# EPIC-0b01f993: Dev Environment Overhaul

## What Was Done

1. **Library watchers in dev controller** — the dev server now watches all library source directories and automatically rebuilds + re-links when files change, eliminating the manual `npx tsc && npm link` cycle.

2. **Auto-install dependencies** — `orqa dev` detects missing `node_modules` across all workspaces and runs `npm ci` before starting, so a fresh checkout just needs `make dev`.

3. **`orqa dev icons` command** — generates all platform icon variants (taskbar, favicon, splash) from the canonical `icons.json` manifest and `generate-icons.mjs` pipeline. Fin logo integrated.

4. **`getRoot()` for CLI** — the CLI can now reliably resolve the project root from any subdirectory, enabling commands to work from anywhere in the monorepo.

## Why

The inner-loop development experience was friction-heavy: manual rebuilds, manual dep installs, manual icon generation. Each friction point slowed iteration and was error-prone. Automating these removes cognitive overhead and lets developers focus on the actual work.
