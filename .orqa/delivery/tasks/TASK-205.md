  Implement prompt-based skill injection in the app's Rust system prompt builder
  using the local embeddings engine for semantic similarity matching.

acceptance:
  - Skill embeddings computed and stored at project load
  - User prompts matched against skill descriptions by cosine similarity
  - Top-N threshold prevents over-injection
  - Dedup against skills already in context

## What

In the app context, use the local ONNX+DuckDB embeddings engine to match user
prompts against skill descriptions and inject the most relevant skills into the
system prompt.

## How

1. Embed each skill's description (one-time at project load)
2. On each user message, embed the prompt
3. Find top-N most relevant skills by cosine similarity
4. Inject skill content into the system prompt
5. Dedup against skills already in context

## Verification

- Skill embeddings are computed and stored
- User prompt returns relevant skills by similarity
- Top-N threshold prevents over-injection
