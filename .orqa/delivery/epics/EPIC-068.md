## Context

UAT round 2 found the dashboard is a column of cards, not a dashboard. Health trends are underutilised, "all clear" wastes space, and refresh/re-index are duplicated. The knowledge pipeline flow model needs rethinking (IDEA-e41039bc).

## Implementation Design

### Design constraints
- Architecture must support drag-and-drop layout customization (not implemented this pass)
- Architecture must support plugin-provided custom widgets (not implemented this pass)
- Widget grid/layout system chosen now must accommodate both constraints later

### Phase 1: Pipeline health widget rework (Theme B)
- Fix stale data after rescan (refresh graph before scanning)
- Auto-fix confirmations → toast notifications
- "All clear" collapses to subtle indicator, expands when errors exist
- Remove duplicate Refresh button (Re-index in statusbar is sufficient)
- Rescan auto-triggers after graph refresh

### Phase 2: Dashboard layout (Theme A)
- Replace vertical card stack with information-dense grid layout
- Health trend sparklines more prominent
- Widget sizing and positioning via grid system
- Remove duplicate Re-index/Refresh buttons

## Tasks

- [TASK-358020c9](TASK-358020c9): Fix rescan stale data — refresh graph before integrity scan
- [TASK-2fcf37c5](TASK-2fcf37c5): Pipeline health: collapse "all clear", remove Refresh button, auto-rescan after refresh
- [TASK-869f3489](TASK-869f3489): Dashboard grid layout system (extensible for drag-drop and plugin widgets)
- [TASK-07a0db5e](TASK-07a0db5e): Health trend widget redesign — more prominent, better integration with grid
- [TASK-181675c6](TASK-181675c6): Knowledge pipeline flow model rethink (IDEA-e41039bc)

## Out of Scope

- Drag-and-drop implementation (architecture supports it, not built yet)
- Plugin widget registration (architecture supports it, not built yet)
- Notification system (EPIC-2649e450)
