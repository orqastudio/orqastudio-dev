## What

Five skills have no current loading mechanism because the features they support are not built yet. They are already referenced from the correct epics/tasks/ideas:

| Skill | Linked From |
|-------|------------|
| `project-inference` | [EPIC-be023ed2](EPIC-be023ed2), [TASK-f1ada1f5](TASK-f1ada1f5) |
| `project-migration` | [EPIC-be023ed2](EPIC-be023ed2), [TASK-f1ada1f5](TASK-f1ada1f5) |
| `project-setup` | [EPIC-be023ed2](EPIC-be023ed2), [TASK-f1ada1f5](TASK-f1ada1f5) |
| `project-type-software` | [EPIC-be023ed2](EPIC-be023ed2), [TASK-f1ada1f5](TASK-f1ada1f5), [TASK-e1d418de](TASK-e1d418de), [EPIC-39860e8b](EPIC-39860e8b) |
| `orqa-plugin-development` | [IDEA-b77e2955](IDEA-b77e2955), [TASK-30307a19](TASK-30307a19) |

Add a note to each skill's SKILL.md frontmatter or body indicating it is forward-looking and which epic/idea it supports. This prevents them from appearing to be active skills that should be loaded.

## How

1. Open each of the five skill files in `.orqa/process/skills/`
2. Add a `status: forward-looking` field or a note block at the top of the body (e.g., `> **Forward-looking:** This skill will be activated by [EPIC-be023ed2](EPIC-be023ed2) when project initialisation is implemented.`)
3. Reference the relevant epic or idea ID in the note
4. Leave all skill content unchanged

## Verification

- [ ] Each of the 5 skills has a clear note that it is forward-looking
- [ ] Each note references the parent epic/idea it will be activated by
- [ ] No changes to the skill content itself — just status clarity
