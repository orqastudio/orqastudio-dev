## Why P1

Architecture decisions are the governing law of the codebase. Every implementation agent must comply with them. Without these decisions, implementation is ungoverned.

## What Was Done

- [AD-dc919e52](AD-dc919e52) through [AD-1d928079](AD-1d928079) recorded in `.orqa/documentation/development/decisions.md`
- Decisions cover: sidecar integration pattern, streaming pipeline design, security model, MCP host approach, persistence strategy, governance format, composability principle
- Each decision includes context, the decision made, consequences, and status

## Output

`.orqa/documentation/development/decisions.md` — the authoritative record of all architecture decisions.

## Notes

Retroactively captured. Work preceded the artifact framework. These decisions remain active and govern all subsequent implementation.

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.

## Tasks

- [TASK-62998ad6](TASK-62998ad6): Record core architecture decisions (AD-dc919e52 through AD-0dbba717)
- [TASK-97dfe088](TASK-97dfe088): Record persistence and governance decisions (AD-5d9ac6bd through AD-8b91f5a4)
- [TASK-cb6280ff](TASK-cb6280ff): Record composability and integration decisions (AD-69072318 through AD-1d928079)
- [TASK-e0b5c973](TASK-e0b5c973): Create architecture decisions index
