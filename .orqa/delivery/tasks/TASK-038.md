title: Null field handling and YAML display ordering
description: "Fixes the artifact detail renderer to suppress null, empty, and invalid-date field values, and makes field render order follow YAML source order rather than a hardcoded list."
status: completed

assignee: AGENT-cc255bc8
acceptance:
  - "Null, empty string, and undefined YAML values are not displayed in read views"
  - Invalid Date never shown for null/missing date fields
  - Fields render in the order they appear in the YAML frontmatter
  - Priority labels (P1/P2/P3) include a human-readable explanation
  - Milestone gate question renders as the last field in the detail view

## Findings Addressed

- **F9**: Null YAML values displayed (promoted-to: null, deadline: Invalid Date)
- **F10**: Milestone gate question should be last
- **F11**: Epic P1/P2/P3 tags unclear in UI

## Investigation Notes

`FrontmatterHeader.svelte` has hardcoded field lists with a predefined render order. The generic "extra fields" loop (line 261) does not filter nulls. Date fields render `Invalid Date` when the value is null.

Current field order is hardcoded in the component. The fix should respect YAML source order instead, with the component simply iterating and rendering — but the YAML field order in the artifacts themselves must be audited to ensure it makes sense from a content hierarchy perspective (separate data quality task [TASK-32932be1](TASK-32932be1)).

## Root Cause

The renderer displays every field it finds rather than filtering meaningless values. Field order is hardcoded in the component rather than derived from the data.
