title: Governance Vision Alignment Audit
description: Audit governance rules (.claude/rules/) and agent definitions (.claude/agents/) for references that contradict the updated vision. These are the enforcement layer — they must accurately reflect .orqa/ as source of truth.

## What

The rules and agent definitions currently reference `.claude/` paths as if
they are the source of truth. Update these to reference `.orqa/` paths.

Note: The rules and agents themselves still live in `.claude/` for CLI
compatibility during the bootstrap phase. The content within them should
reference `.orqa/` as the canonical location.

## Also Audit

- `ui/brand-identity.md` — check for Claude-specific branding
- `ui/design-system.md` — check for Claude-specific language

## Deliverable

Updated rule and agent files with a summary of changes.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
