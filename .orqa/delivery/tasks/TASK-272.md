title: Implement rule-overrides in pre-commit hook
description: "Pre-commit hook checks if the commit references a task with rule-overrides that suspend a failing validation rule. If so, warn but don't block."

acceptance:
  - Pre-commit hook reads rule-overrides from referenced task/epic
  - Suspended validation rules produce warnings instead of blocking
  - Non-suspended validation rules still block on failure
  - Clear output distinguishing warnings (suspended) from errors (blocking)

## What

Extend the pre-commit hook to be aware of scoped rule suspensions. When a validation fails for a rule that is suspended on the active task/epic, emit a warning instead of blocking the commit.

## How

1. Determine active task from commit message or `tmp/session-state.md`
2. Read task's `rule-overrides` (fall back to epic's)
3. When schema validation or other rule-based checks fail, check if the failing rule is suspended
4. Suspended: print warning with reason, continue
5. Not suspended: block as normal

## Verification

- Stage an artifact that would fail [RULE-a764b2ae](RULE-a764b2ae) validation
- Commit with a message referencing a task that suspends [RULE-a764b2ae](RULE-a764b2ae) — commit succeeds with warning
- Commit without task reference — commit blocked as normal
