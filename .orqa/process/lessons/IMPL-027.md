title: "Plugin requirements are shaped by plugin type, not universal"
description: "Not all plugins integrate with AI providers. A plugin could be a frontend visualisation, a data transformer, or a governance extension. The requires object in plugin.json should be determined by the plugin's type — different types have different requirement shapes. 'sidecar' is an implementation term; 'ai-providers' or similar is more human-readable."

## Pattern

The initial design assumed `requires.sidecar` as a universal plugin field. But plugins have different types:

- **AI provider integration** — hooks, skills, agents designed for a specific AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). These need `requires.ai-providers`.
- **Frontend visualisation** — custom views, dashboards, data rendering. No AI provider dependency.
- **Governance extension** — additional rules, schemas, artifact types. No AI provider dependency.
- **Data transformer** — processing pipelines, import/export. May or may not need an AI provider.

Key design decisions (user-approved):
- `type` is an array — a single plugin can be `["ai-provider-integration", "visualisation"]`
- The type enum is extendable — new types can be added without breaking existing plugins
- The `requires` shape is the union of all declared types

The `requires` object should be shaped by the plugin type. An AI provider integration plugin has `requires.ai-providers: { any-of: ["claude-code-cli"] }`. A visualisation plugin has no such field because it doesn't interact with AI providers at all.

Additionally:
- The array semantics matter: `any-of` (plugin works with any listed provider, only one needs to be active) vs `all` (all listed providers must be available)
- Adding a new AI provider to the ecosystem should trigger a review of existing plugins and surface to plugin developers
- "sidecar" is an internal implementation term — user-facing config should use "ai-providers" or similar

## Fix

Design plugin type system where each type defines its own `requires` shape. The plugin schema validates `requires` fields against the declared type.
