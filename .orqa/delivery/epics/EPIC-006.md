## Why P2

Without this, CLI edits to governance files and `.orqa/` artifacts aren't reflected in the app until manual refresh. Important for dogfooding where both the CLI and app are used simultaneously.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add `notify` crate for filesystem watching
- [ ] Watch `.claude/` and `.orqa/` directories for external modifications
- [ ] Refresh artifact list and viewer when files change on disk
- [ ] Debounce rapid changes (editor auto-save)

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
