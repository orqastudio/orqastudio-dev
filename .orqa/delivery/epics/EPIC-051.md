title: Provider-Agnostic Tool Abstraction Layer
description: |
  Replace concrete tool names in agent definitions with abstract capabilities.
  Create a rule that maps capabilities to provider-specific tools per context
  (CLI, App, future providers). Update all agent definitions and the delegation
  protocol to use the abstraction.

## Context

Agent definitions currently list concrete tool names from multiple AI providers in a
flat `tools:` array:

```yaml
tools:
  - Read                                    # Claude Code CLI
  - Grep                                    # Claude Code CLI
  - mcp__chunkhound__search_regex           # CLI MCP server
  - search_regex                            # OrqaStudio App (Tauri)
```

This creates three problems:

1. **Context mismatch**: When the orchestrator spawns a subagent in CLI context, the
   agent definition includes app-only tool names that don't exist. Subagents fail or
   use wrong tools. This is happening now — every delegation attempt hits this issue
   because we're always in CLI context (not dogfooding yet).

2. **Provider lock-in**: Tool names (`Read`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep`) are
   Claude Code specific. Adding another AI provider would require rewriting every
   agent definition.

3. **No enforcement**: The "Operating Context" prose section in agent definitions
   describes both contexts but nothing mechanically resolves the right tools at
   delegation time.

### Agent SDK Hook Discovery

The Claude Agent SDK exposes 12 hook events that map to enforcement points. The key
ones for tool resolution:

| Hook Event | Use for Tool Abstraction |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `SessionStart` | Inject resolved tool list for current provider |
| `SubagentStart` | Inject agent-specific resolved tools when subagent spawns |
| `PreToolUse` | Validate tool access against agent's declared capabilities |

The SDK also exposes `canUseTool` callback, `allowedTools`/`disallowedTools` lists,
and `plugins` — all of which can consume the capability → tool mapping.

## Implementation Design

### Phase 1: Capability Rule (immediate, governs current CLI usage)

Create RULE-NNN that defines:

1. **The abstract capability vocabulary** — canonical names for what agents can do
2. **The provider mapping table** — capabilities → concrete tools per context
3. **The delegation protocol** — orchestrator MUST resolve capabilities to tools
   before spawning any subagent
4. **The detection mechanism** — how to determine current context (CLI vs App)

This rule is immediately enforceable because the orchestrator reads rules before
delegating.

#### Capability Vocabulary

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `file_read` | Read file contents |
| `file_write` | Create new files |
| `file_edit` | Edit existing files |
| `file_search` | Find files by name/pattern |
| `content_search` | Search file contents by pattern |
| `code_search_regex` | Exact pattern code search |
| `code_search_semantic` | Meaning-based code search |
| `code_research` | Architectural analysis |
| `shell_execute` | Run shell commands |
| `skill_load` | Load a skill into agent context |

#### Provider Mapping: Claude Code CLI

| Capability | Tool Name | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `file_read` | `Read` | Built-in |
| `file_write` | `Write` | Built-in |
| `file_edit` | `Edit` | Built-in |
| `file_search` | `Glob` | Built-in |
| `content_search` | `Grep` | Built-in |
| `code_search_regex` | `mcp__chunkhound__search_regex` | MCP server required |
| `code_search_semantic` | `mcp__chunkhound__search_semantic` | MCP server required |
| `code_research` | `mcp__chunkhound__code_research` | MCP server required |
| `shell_execute` | `Bash` | Built-in |
| `skill_load` | `Skill` | Built-in |

#### Provider Mapping: OrqaStudio App

| Capability | Tool Name | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `file_read` | `read` | Tauri command |
| `file_write` | `write` | Tauri command |
| `file_edit` | `edit` | Tauri command |
| `file_search` | `glob` | Tauri command |
| `content_search` | `grep` | Tauri command |
| `code_search_regex` | `search_regex` | Native ONNX+DuckDB |
| `code_search_semantic` | `search_semantic` | Native ONNX+DuckDB |
| `code_research` | `code_research` | Native ONNX+DuckDB |
| `shell_execute` | `bash` | Tauri command |
| `skill_load` | `load_skill` | Tauri command |

### Phase 2: Agent Definition Migration

Update all 7 agent definitions to use capabilities instead of concrete tools.
Capabilities **replace** tools entirely — the rule (RULE-92dba0cb) owns the mapping
from capabilities to provider-specific tools. Agent definitions only declare
what they need, never how it's provided.

**Before:**
```yaml
tools:
  - Read
  - Edit
  - Write
  - Glob
  - Grep
  - Bash
  - mcp__chunkhound__search_regex
  - mcp__chunkhound__search_semantic
  - mcp__chunkhound__code_research
  - search_regex
  - search_semantic
  - code_research
```

**After:**
```yaml
capabilities:
  - file_read
  - file_write
  - file_edit
  - file_search
  - content_search
  - code_search_regex
  - code_search_semantic
  - code_research
  - shell_execute
```

Update the agent schema: remove `tools` field, add `capabilities` (array of strings).

### Phase 3: Companion Plugin Resolution (when [EPIC-3a8ad459](EPIC-3a8ad459) lands)

The companion plugin reads agent `capabilities` and resolves them to Claude Code
tool names automatically via `SubagentStart` hooks. This eliminates the need for
the orchestrator to manually resolve in delegation prompts.

### Phase 4: App-Native Resolution

The Rust backend reads agent `capabilities` and resolves them to Tauri tool names
when building agent execution context. Same mapping table, different consumer.

## Out of Scope

- **Capability discovery** — agents declare what they need, they don't discover what's available
- **Dynamic capability negotiation** — no runtime capability checking between providers
- **Cross-provider agent migration** — switching providers mid-session
- **Tool versioning** — capabilities don't carry version constraints
