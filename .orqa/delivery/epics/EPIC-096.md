# EPIC-cdb03816: Pre-Connector Switch — System Architecture

## Goal

Get the system architecture right before switching to the Claude Code connector. This avoids switching then immediately refactoring under stricter governance conditions.

## Deliverables

1. **Native search as MCP** — expose search_regex, search_semantic as MCP tools from the app binary
2. **code_research implementation** — compound search tool built on regex + semantic
3. **Search skill consolidation** — merge chunkhound + orqa-code-search + orqa-native-search into one `search` skill
4. **Skill sync refactor** — sync only proactive skills (coding standards, agent preloads); rest available via MCP on demand
5. **ONNX model download** — download BGE-small model as part of this epic for dev use (NOT bundled in app by default)
6. **Connector cleanup** — final audit, remove stale references, verify all hooks/agents/skills work end-to-end
