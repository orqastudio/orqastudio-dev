## What

Create comprehensive architecture documentation that maps the entire OrqaStudio core application end-to-end.

## How

1. Map every Rust module, its purpose, and its dependencies
2. Map every frontend store and its relationship to backend commands
3. Document the streaming pipeline (LLM → sidecar → Rust → Svelte)
4. Document the artifact system (scanning, graph, rendering)
5. Document the enforcement pipeline (rules → engine → gates → injection)
6. Document the learning loop (lessons → promotion → rules)
7. Document the prompt injection pipeline (system prompt → skills → context)

## Verification

A reader can trace any feature from UI to database by following the architecture doc.
