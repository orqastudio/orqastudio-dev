## What

The `user-invocable` field in skill YAML frontmatter is undocumented — there's no rule or documentation defining what it means, when to set it to `true` vs `false`, or how the system uses it. This is an implicit convention that should be formalized.

## How

1. Search existing skills for `user-invocable: true` and `user-invocable: false` to understand the current pattern
2. Determine the next available RULE number
3. Create the rule covering: definition (user-invocable skills can be triggered directly as slash commands or from the UI; non-invocable skills are only loaded into agent context), criteria for setting the value, how the system surfaces user-invocable skills (CLI slash commands, app skill picker), FORBIDDEN patterns
4. Audit all existing skills to verify their `user-invocable` values are correct per the new rule

## Verification

- [ ] New rule created with clear user-invocable semantics
- [ ] Criteria defined for when a skill should be user-invocable
- [ ] System behavior for each value documented
- [ ] All existing skills audited for correct values
