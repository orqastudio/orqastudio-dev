## What

Add the Tier 2 skill injection table to the orchestrator's agent definition and update
the skill-enforcement rule to document the three-tier loading model.

## Implementation Notes

The injection table maps task scope (file paths/directories) to the project-specific
skills that should be loaded. The orchestrator includes these skills in the delegation
prompt when creating tasks for agents.
