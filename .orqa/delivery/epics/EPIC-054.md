## Governing Principles

These are the architectural principles established in recent sessions that this epic
enforces. Every task in this epic must preserve and strengthen these principles.

### 1. Graph-Based Knowledge Injection

The artifact graph is the knowledge system. Hooks inject **artifact IDs only** (TASK-NNN,
SKILL-NNN, DOC-NNN) — never content, never indexes. Agents have Read tooling and graph
traversal knowledge to resolve IDs to files on demand. This keeps injection lightweight
and context-efficient.

**Implication:** Any artifact whose content would confuse an agent if loaded via graph
traversal is a data integrity problem, not a "historical record." Completed artifacts
that describe superseded approaches must be clearly marked so the graph doesn't inject
stale patterns.

### 2. Three-Layer Architecture

| Layer | What | Portability Test |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Core** | Clarity engine firmware — universal principles, process model, schemas | Would this work unchanged on a Python/Django project? |
| **Project** | This project's patterns — Tauri/Svelte/Rust conventions, orqa-* skills | Does this reference OrqaStudio-specific paths, technologies, or patterns? |
| **Plugin** | CLI compatibility — hooks, commands, session management | Does this exist to make the graph work in Claude Code specifically? |

**Implication:** Core rules must not contain project-specific examples. Core skills must
not reference project-specific paths. The layer field on every artifact must be accurate.

### 3. Schema as Single Source of Truth for Field Shapes

`schema.json` defines what fields exist, their types, constraints, and relationships.
`artifact-framework.md` defines lifecycle and process semantics. READMEs provide
orientation but must not duplicate or contradict either source.

**Implication:** No README should contain a field reference table. No artifact should
have fields not in the schema. No schema should allow fields the process doesn't define.

### 4. Enforcement via Relationships

Rules have enforcement entries (block/warn/inject actions). Skills are injected based
on path patterns. The graph-guardian checks relationship integrity. Process gates fire
at transitions. This replaces content-heavy injection with lightweight ID-based injection.

**Implication:** The `.claude/rules/` symlink loading ALL 44 rule bodies into every CLI
session is an architectural tension. Core rules should be minimal principles; project
detail belongs in skills injected on demand.

### 5. Honest Status

Every artifact's status must reflect reality. A done epic with incomplete deliverables,
a draft epic whose tasks are all complete, or a todo task whose work is verified done —
these are lies in the graph that cause downstream confusion.

## Context

Three research investigations ([RES-0a32a350](RES-0a32a350), [RES-5d1fa2a8](RES-5d1fa2a8), [RES-87c6d062](RES-87c6d062))
audited 476+ artifacts across all layers. Critical findings:

**Data Integrity:**
- [SKILL-e3a559c9](SKILL-e3a559c9) ID assigned to 3 different skills (graph traversal breaks)
- SKILL-bcfeb64e exists as divergent copies (not symlinked)
- 20+ epics reference DOC-NNN phantom IDs (unresolvable graph edges)
- 4 different scoring dimension sets across epics (priority comparison meaningless)
- [EPIC-0a7b21cf](EPIC-0a7b21cf) fully complete but all tasks marked todo
- [EPIC-03900ea5](EPIC-03900ea5) marked done but superseded by [EPIC-897bbe8f](EPIC-897bbe8f)

**Layer Violations:**
- 8 core rules embed project-specific Tauri/Svelte/Rust content
- composability skill (core) has 37 project-specific references
- orqa-native-search marked core but is project-specific
- orqa-code-search marked project but treated as universal

**Content Staleness:**
- orchestration.md and workflow.md describe pre-graph patterns
- Planning README mentions deprecated "plans" artifact type
- Documentation README uses web-style links violating [RULE-2f7b6a31](RULE-2f7b6a31)
- [EPIC-31c9baca](EPIC-31c9baca) uses `canon` terminology (now `core`)
- [RES-8b971acf](RES-8b971acf) references non-existent `.orqa/agents/` path

**Structural:**
- Tasks README duplicates and diverges from schema.json
- No architecture doc for graph-based injection model
- 3 rules have empty scope arrays
- [RES-5a9e6375](RES-5a9e6375)-tauri-dev-process-management.md has mismatched filename/ID

## Implementation Design

Work is organised into phases by blast radius and dependency order.

### Phase 1: Data Integrity Fixes

Fix broken graph edges and status lies. These are factual corrections, not opinion.

### Phase 2: Layer Reclassification

Correct layer fields on misclassified artifacts. Split core rules/skills that contain
project-specific content.

### Phase 3: Content Accuracy

Update stale content, fix README issues, resolve the canonical definition question.

### Phase 4: Structural Cleanup

Archive stale ideas, mark surpassed research, connect orphaned artifacts, standardise
scoring dimensions.

## Out of Scope

- Implementing new enforcement layers (EPIC-4440cdd4 scope)
- Building auto-generation tooling for READMEs (future idea, not this epic)
- Rewriting the plugin hooks (already aligned with graph principles)
- Creating the DOC-NNN artifact type (separate epic if decided)
- Wireframe/UI doc accuracy audit (separate review needed post-implementation)
