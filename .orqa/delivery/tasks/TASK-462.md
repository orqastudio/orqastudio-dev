  - "Zero \"Phase 2a\", \"Phase 2b\", or numbered phase references remain in any documentation file"
  - Phase references replaced with epic names (EPIC-NNN) or removed if context is obsolete

## Scope

### Restructure DOC-4b4fbc0f (coding-standards.md)

Currently: sparse reference material restating rules. Restructure to lead with **why** — what "good code" means in this project, the principles behind the standards, how standards serve the pillars. Reference material (specific rules, lint configs) follows.

### Restructure DOC-b10607c0 (orchestration.md)

Currently: 100% procedural. Restructure to lead with **purpose** — why the orchestrator exists, what delegation means, why the orchestrator doing implementation work is a system failure. The delegation reference (TASK-46275b63) will complement this.

### Remove Phase References

Search all `.orqa/documentation/` files for "Phase 2a", "Phase 2b", "Phase 0", "Phase 1", etc. Replace with epic names or remove if the context is obsolete. Files known to have phase refs: DOC-d498eac8, DOC-dacb6315, DOC-1b0a39a1, DOC-0339700d, DOC-7d811a5d (if still exists after merge).

### Clarify or Delete Ambiguous Docs

- DOC-051 (engagement-infrastructure) — unclear scope, read and decide: expand or delete
- DOC-b513c6b2 (metrics) — very short, unclear purpose, read and decide
- DOC-045 (system-artifacts) — scope unclear, read and decide
- DOC-c8de180d (priority-assessment) — vague criteria, read and decide
