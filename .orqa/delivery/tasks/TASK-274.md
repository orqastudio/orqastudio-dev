## What

First backfill batch — rules are the enforcement layer and the most impactful to connect. Each rule gets a `grounded` relationship pointing to the decision or pillar it serves.

## How

1. Run backfill tool against all rules
2. Review proposals — for each rule, the tool proposes which decision/pillar it's grounded in
3. Approve, reject, or edit each proposal
4. Commit the batch

## Verification

- All 44 rules have `relationships` array in frontmatter
- No rule has an empty relationships array (at minimum grounded, even if null with rationale)
- Spot-check 5 rules for correct connections
