title: Extract project-specific requirements to graph-readable artifacts
description: "Move project-specific sections from the orchestrator prompt to standalone artifacts discoverable via graph traversal — tech stack, naming conventions, verification gates."

## What

The orchestrator prompt's "Section 2: Project-Specific Requirements" is ~500 lines of content that should live in the artifact graph, not be inlined into every session.

## How

1. Identify all project-specific content blocks in orchestrator.md
2. For each block, determine the right destination artifact (project.json, coding-standards.md, skill, etc.)
3. Move content to destination, ensuring it's complete and self-contained
4. Update graph edges so the content is discoverable

## Verification

- Orchestrator prompt no longer contains project-specific tech stack details
- Content exists in appropriate artifacts with proper graph relationships
- Coding standards, naming conventions, and verification gates are all findable via graph
