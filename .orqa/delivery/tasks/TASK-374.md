## What

Build a repeatable automated gap audit tool that replaces the manual [RES-dd35bbf0](RES-dd35bbf0) audit.

## How

Extend verify-pipeline-integrity.mjs or create a new script that scans all rules for enforcement mechanism, all ADs for enforcement chain completeness, all lessons for promotion status, and pipeline stage transitions for gaps. Output a prioritized gap report.

## Verification

Completed as part of [EPIC-4e6e9eae](EPIC-4e6e9eae) Phase 7.

## Lessons

No new lessons.
