## What

Surface the native integrity checks on the project dashboard so users can see pipeline health at a glance and run scans on demand.

## How

1. Add IntegrityCheck types to `ui/src/lib/types/artifact-graph.ts`
2. Add `runIntegrityScan()` method to `artifactGraphSDK`
3. Create `IntegrityWidget.svelte` component in `ui/src/lib/components/dashboard/`
4. Integrate into `ProjectDashboard.svelte`

## Verification

- `make typecheck` passes
- Widget renders on dashboard with scan results
- Clicking Scan refreshes the findings
