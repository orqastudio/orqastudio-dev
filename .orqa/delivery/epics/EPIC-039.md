## Implementation Design

### Backend Extractions
- `stream_commands.rs` (2,425 lines) → 4 domain modules
- `setup_commands.rs` → `domain::setup`
- `governance_commands.rs` → `domain::governance_analysis`
- `artifact_commands.rs` → `domain::artifact_reader` + repo modules
- Project settings I/O → repo layer
- Timestamp utils → `domain::time_utils`
- Path constants → `domain::paths`
- Search commands → OrqaError (not String)

### Frontend Extractions
- SettingsView → focused sub-components
- Toolbar → focused sub-components
- Conversation store decoupled from session store
- Missing error/loading states added

### Cross-Cutting
- 60+ hardcoded colors → semantic design tokens
- Cross-platform make targets
- Security hardening (CSP, capability restrictions)

## Produced Decision

[AD-6cd1ff6f](AD-6cd1ff6f) (Domain Service Extraction Pattern)

## Git Evidence

- `7fd306e` through `d0fa094` — Full refactoring series (2026-03-06 to 2026-03-07)

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Tasks
