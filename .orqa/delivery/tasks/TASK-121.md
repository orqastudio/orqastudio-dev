## What

Designed the MCP host interface for future external MCP server support, covering connection lifecycle, tool routing, and configuration format.

## How

Defined the discover/connect/list-tools lifecycle states, designed a unified tool router that dispatches to either built-in handlers or external MCP servers by tool name prefix, and documented the `.mcp.json` configuration format.

## Verification

MCP host interface design is documented with lifecycle, routing strategy, and configuration format specified for future implementation.
