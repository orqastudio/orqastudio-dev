  - "ui/package.json uses versioned @orqastudio/* dependencies (no file: references)"
  - "ui/.npmrc configures @orqastudio scope to GitHub Packages registry"
  - npm install succeeds from registry
  - All 218 existing tests pass
  - svelte-check passes (same error count as before)
  - App builds and runs correctly
  - make verify-integrity works with published integrity-validator

## Scope

Replace in ui/package.json:
- `"@orqastudio/types": "file:../../orqa-types"` → `"@orqastudio/types": "^0.1.0"`
- `"@orqastudio/sdk": "file:../../orqa-sdk"` → `"@orqastudio/sdk": "^0.1.0"`
- Same for eslint-config, test-config, integrity-validator

Add ui/.npmrc:
```
@orqastudio:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Verify everything still works end-to-end.
