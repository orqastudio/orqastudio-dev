## Scope

Delete 3 documentation files identified as duplicates or stale by the documentation audit ([RES-17a8e33f](RES-17a8e33f)):

1. **DOC-019** (`development/architecture-overview.md`) — 118-line stub that duplicates DOC-001 (core-architecture.md, 696 lines). No unique content.
2. **DOC-054** (`product/launch-timeline.md`) — References outdated "Phase" numbering for a past launch. No longer relevant.
3. **DOC-032** (`process/rules.md`) — Describes rule structure already defined authoritatively in RULE-deab6ea7 (skill-enforcement).

After deletion, search all `.orqa/` files for references to these IDs and update or remove them.
