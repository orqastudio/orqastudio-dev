## What

Backfill AD → Rule enforcement relationships for 37 accepted ADs that lacked structured enforcement edges.

## How

For each AD, determine if a rule enforces it, a skill practices it, or it is a strategy decision with no enforceable constraint. Add the appropriate relationship edges.

## Verification

Completed as part of [EPIC-4e6e9eae](EPIC-4e6e9eae) Phase 1.

## Lessons

No new lessons.
