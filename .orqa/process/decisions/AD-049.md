title: Icon-based status representation — colors reserved for artifact types
description: Status is represented by iconography (circle variants) not colors. The color palette is reserved exclusively for artifact type identity. This prevents visual conflict between type and status channels.

## Decision

Status across all artifact types is represented by **icons**, not colors. The circle is the constant shape; what's inside it communicates the status.

## Status Icon Map

| Status Group | Icon | Statuses | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unshaped | `Circle` | draft, captured, proposed | Exists but not shaped yet |
| Exploring | `Compass` | exploring | Under investigation |
| Waiting | `CircleDot` | todo, ready, shaped | Shaped and waiting to be picked up |
| Active | `CircleArrowRight` | in-progress, review | Active work happening |
| Complete | `CircleCheck` | done, complete, accepted, promoted | Finished |
| Closed | `CircleMinus` | inactive, archived, surpassed, superseded | No longer active |
| Recurring | `CircleEllipsis` | recurring | Pattern detected — needs promotion |
| Action needed | `CircleAlert` | action-needed | Human attention required |

## Rationale

- **Color is already used for artifact type identity** — EPIC, TASK, RULE etc. each have a distinct color configured in project settings. Adding status colors creates visual noise.
- **Icons carry meaning independent of color** — a CircleCheck means "done" regardless of whether the artifact is blue (EPIC) or teal (TASK).
- **The circle constant** — all status icons share the circle shape, making them scannable as a family. What varies is the interior (empty, dot, check, arrow, etc.).
- **Compass for exploring** — matches the Discovery main-nav icon, maintaining consistency between navigation and status vocabulary.

## Consequences

- StatusIndicator component changes from colored dots to icons
- ArtifactLink chips use status icons instead of colored dots
- Pipeline stepper uses status icons
- Graph visualization can use icons or remain color-coded (graph nodes already use type colors)
- All status-to-color mappings in StatusIndicator.svelte are replaced with status-to-icon mappings
