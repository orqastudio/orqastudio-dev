## What

The orchestrator (CLAUDE.md) lists `rust-async-patterns`, `svelte5-best-practices`, `tailwind-design-system`, `typescript-advanced-types`, and `tauri-v2` as Tier 1 ("declared in agent YAML, loaded automatically"). They are actually Tier 2 — injected by the orchestrator based on task scope, not auto-loaded by agents.

## How

1. Open the orchestrator's Skills section (CLAUDE.md / orchestrator.md)
2. Move the five tech skills from the Tier 1 table into the Tier 2 injection table with appropriate scope triggers (e.g., `rust-async-patterns` when touching `backend/src-tauri/`)
3. Update the Tier 1 definition text to make clear it covers only universal, always-loaded skills
4. Search agent YAML files in `.orqa/process/agents/` for any `skills:` list entries referencing the five tech skills and remove them

## Verification

- [ ] Orchestrator Tier 1 table contains only universal skills
- [ ] Five tech skills moved to Tier 2 injection table with appropriate scope triggers
- [ ] Tier 1 definition updated to clarify purpose (universal principles, not domain tech)
- [ ] No agent YAML skills lists contain tech stack skills
