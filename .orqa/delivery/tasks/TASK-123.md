## What

Initialized the Tauri v2 project with a Svelte 5 frontend template and configured all required plugins, build tooling, and development scripts.

## How

Used the Tauri v2 CLI to scaffold the project, then wired up Svelte 5, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and TypeScript. Created the Makefile with `dev`, `build`, `check`, and related targets.

## Verification

`make dev` launches the app, HMR reloads on Svelte file changes, and Tauri plugins are accessible from the frontend.
