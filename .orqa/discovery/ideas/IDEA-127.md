# IDEA-9c58fbb6: Git as a Plugin

## Concept

Git integration should be a first-party OrqaStudio plugin (`@orqastudio/plugin-git`) that:

1. **Ships enabled by default** — every OrqaStudio project gets git enforcement out of the box
2. **Centralises githooks** — the plugin is the single source of truth for pre-commit, pre-push, and commit-msg hooks across all repos in an organisation
3. **Enforces quality checks** — same checks (integrity validation, frontmatter compliance, relationship bidirectionality) run consistently across every repo
4. **Organisation-mode sync** — in org mode, hook config propagates from the organisation root to all child projects, with override tracking
5. **User warning on disable** — disabling the plugin shows a clear warning that version history tracking and enforcement of artifact data integrity will be lost

## Why

Currently git setup is manual and inconsistent. Each project may or may not have hooks, and there's no guarantee they enforce the same checks. Making git a plugin means:

- Enforcement is declarative and version-controlled
- New projects get hooks automatically
- Organisation-level policy is enforceable
- The app can surface hook violations in the UI (not just the terminal)

**Strategic:** By packaging version control as a plugin rather than a hard dependency, we create the platform to build custom cloud hosting into the app in the future without relying on git. A cloud-hosted artifact store could be a second version-control plugin that implements the same enforcement interfaces — the app doesn't care whether persistence comes from git or a hosted service, it just needs a plugin that satisfies the contract.

## Key Design Considerations

- Hook templates should be generated from rules (same pattern as coding standards plugins)
- The plugin should detect existing `.git/hooks/` and offer migration
- Must work with husky/lint-staged if already installed (coexistence or migration)
- Pre-commit hook should run `orqa validate` (or a fast subset)
- Commit-msg hook could enforce conventional commits or artifact ID references
