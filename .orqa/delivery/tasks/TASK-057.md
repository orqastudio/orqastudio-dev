## Context

Tasks within an epic often have execution order dependencies (e.g., can't remove
old agents before extracting their domain knowledge into skills). Currently there
is no formal mechanism — dependencies are written as prose in the task body.

This task adds `depends-on` as a first-class frontmatter field with lifecycle
enforcement.

## What

See task description and acceptance criteria in frontmatter.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
