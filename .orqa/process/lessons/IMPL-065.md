title: Static markdown views should be dynamic graph views when the data exists
description: "The roadmap is a manually maintained markdown page, but all the data (milestones, epics, tasks, statuses, priorities) already lives in the artifact graph. Maintaining a static view of dynamic data guarantees staleness."

    rationale: "Roadmap kanban view replaces static doc with dynamic graph view"

## Pattern

The roadmap documentation page lists milestones, epics, and their statuses in manually written markdown. Every time an epic's status changes, the roadmap is stale until someone updates it. This is a maintenance burden and a source of drift between reality and documentation.

The data already exists in the graph — milestones have epics, epics have statuses and priorities, tasks have statuses. A dynamic view can render the roadmap from the graph with zero maintenance.

## Fix

Replace static documentation views with dynamic graph-queried views wherever the data model supports it. The roadmap is the first candidate. Epic task lists (F19) are the second. Any page that lists artifacts with status is a candidate.
