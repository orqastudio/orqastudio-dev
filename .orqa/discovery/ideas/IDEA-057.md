title: Provider-Agnostic Tool Abstraction for Agent Definitions
description: |
  Agent definitions should declare tool capabilities abstractly (e.g. "file_read",
  "code_search"), not concrete tool names. A rule governs how abstract capabilities
  map to provider-specific tools at runtime, making agent definitions portable
  across AI providers.

research-needed:
- Audit current tool availability per context (CLI Claude Code, App native, future providers)
- Map concrete tools to abstract capabilities
- Design the capability → tool resolution mechanism
- Determine where the mapping lives (rule, skill, or config)

## Motivation

Agent definitions currently list concrete tool names from multiple providers in a flat
array (`Read`, `mcp__chunkhound__search_regex`, `search_regex`). This causes three
problems:

1. **Context mismatch** — When agents are spawned in CLI context, they receive tool
   names that only exist in the app context (and vice versa). Subagents fail silently
   or use wrong tools.

2. **Provider lock-in** — Tool names are Claude Code specific (`Read`, `Edit`, `Bash`,
   `Glob`, `Grep`). If OrqaStudio adds support for another AI provider (Cursor, Copilot,
   Aider), every agent definition would need rewriting.

3. **No enforcement** — Nothing ensures the orchestrator passes the right tool context
   when delegating. The "Operating Context" section in agent definitions is prose that
   gets ignored in practice.

The fix is to separate **what an agent can do** (abstract capabilities) from **how it
does it** (provider-specific tool names). Agent definitions declare capabilities. A rule
defines the mapping from capabilities to tools per provider context. The orchestrator
(or plugin, or app) resolves at delegation time.

## Sketch

### Abstract Capability Model

Agent definitions declare capabilities, not tools:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - file_read
  - file_write
  - file_search
  - content_search
  - code_search_regex
  - code_search_semantic
  - code_research
  - shell_execute
```

### Provider Tool Mappings (governed by rule)

A rule defines the canonical mapping. Each provider context resolves differently:

| Capability | Claude Code CLI | OrqaStudio App | Future Provider X |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| `file_read` | `Read` | `read` (Tauri) | provider-specific |
| `file_write` | `Write` | `write` (Tauri) | provider-specific |
| `file_edit` | `Edit` | `edit` (Tauri) | provider-specific |
| `file_search` | `Glob` | `glob` (Tauri) | provider-specific |
| `content_search` | `Grep` | `grep` (Tauri) | provider-specific |
| `code_search_regex` | `mcp__chunkhound__search_regex` | `search_regex` | provider-specific |
| `code_search_semantic` | `mcp__chunkhound__search_semantic` | `search_semantic` | provider-specific |
| `code_research` | `mcp__chunkhound__code_research` | `code_research` | provider-specific |
| `shell_execute` | `Bash` | `bash` (Tauri) | provider-specific |
| `skill_load` | `Skill` | `load_skill` (Tauri) | provider-specific |

### Resolution Points

- **CLI (companion plugin)**: Plugin reads agent definitions, resolves capabilities
  to Claude Code tool names, passes correct `tools:` list when spawning subagents
- **App (native)**: Rust backend resolves capabilities to Tauri command names when
  building the agent execution context
- **Orchestrator (interim)**: Until the plugin exists, the orchestrator rule ensures
  correct resolution in delegation prompts

### Why a Rule

The mapping is a constraint, not a feature. It governs how all agents interact with
tools regardless of which provider runs them. Rules are:
- Loaded by every agent automatically
- Enforced mechanically (via the enforcement engine once [EPIC-3a8ad459](EPIC-3a8ad459) lands)
- Visible in the governance UI
- Extensible per provider without touching agent definitions
