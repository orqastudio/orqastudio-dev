title: Plugin-Based Tool Architecture
description: "Redesign the tool system so tools are implemented as plugins rather than hardcoded Rust functions — enabling user-created tools, community tool packs, and dynamic tool registration without app rebuilds."

research-needed:
  - "How are tools currently implemented? (Rust functions in backend/src-tauri/src/tools/, registered in the tool registry)"
  - "What is the current tool registration mechanism? (compile-time or runtime?)"
  - "Could tools be defined as WASM modules, external scripts, or MCP servers instead of Rust functions?"
  - "How does MCP's tool protocol relate to this? (MCP already defines a tool interface — could native tools use the same protocol?)"
  - "What security boundaries are needed for user-created tools? (file system access, network, process spawning)"
  - "How does this relate to AD-0dbba717 (Tool Implementation as MCP) and the existing plugin system ideas (IDEA-b77e2955)?"
  - "What's the migration path from hardcoded tools to plugin tools without breaking existing functionality?"

> **Surpassed 2026-03-16**: Plugin architecture concept merged into EPIC-3f65c703 via AD-c6abc8e6. Runtime tool registration (WASM/MCP/script formats, capability-based permissions) split into IDEA-2dfe18ae as architecturally distinct from artifact/view plugins.

## Motivation

Currently tools are Rust functions compiled into the app binary. Adding a new tool requires modifying Rust source code, recompiling, and shipping an app update. This is the opposite of the composability principle — tools are the least pluggable part of the system.

If tools used a plugin interface:

1. **Users could create custom tools** — project-specific file processors, API integrators, domain-specific validators
2. **Community tool packs** — shared tool collections installable without app rebuilds
3. **Tool skills become tool documentation** — each plugin tool ships with its companion skill (IDEA-59ce25c3)
4. **MCP alignment** — MCP already defines a tool protocol. If native tools used the same interface, internal and external tools would be interchangeable
5. **Composability** — tools become small, swappable units with defined interfaces, exactly matching the composability principle

## Sketch

- Tool interface: defined inputs (JSON schema), defined outputs, capability declarations (fs read, fs write, network, process)
- Plugin formats: WASM modules (sandboxed, cross-platform), MCP servers (existing protocol), external scripts (simple but less secure)
- Tool registry: runtime discovery from a tools directory, not compile-time registration
- Security: capability-based permissions per tool (read-only tools vs write tools vs network tools)
- Migration: existing Rust tools wrapped in the plugin interface, new tools can be either native or plugin
- Relates to [AD-0dbba717](AD-0dbba717) (MCP tools), [IDEA-b77e2955](IDEA-b77e2955) (plugin system), [IDEA-59ce25c3](IDEA-59ce25c3) (tool-linked skills)
