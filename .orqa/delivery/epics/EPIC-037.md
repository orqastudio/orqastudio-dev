## Implementation Design

### Phase 1: Governance Alignment
- Hook paths updated to use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
- TODO rewritten for dogfood milestone
- Governance artifacts aligned with codebase

### Phase 2: Frontend Audit
- Debug logging removed
- `any` types fixed
- Documentation aligned with implementation

### Phase 3: Function Decomposition
- Oversized functions broken down
- Root directory cleaned

### Phase 4: Enforcement Engine
- Governance scanning logic
- Tool approval workflow via Channel<T>
- Model selection UI
- Enforcement UI and scanner dashboard
- Process violation detection and display

### Phase 5: Self-Learning Loop
- Lesson promotion pipeline: IMPL entries → recurrence tracking → rule promotion
- Config-driven recurrence threshold

### Phase 6: SDK Integration
- Session resume across app restarts
- `code_research` native tool implementation
- Process violation hook fixes

## Git Evidence

- `1481f00` through `3a469da` — Full sprint (2026-03-05)
- `0aab794` — Fix error swallowing and settings persistence

## Context
