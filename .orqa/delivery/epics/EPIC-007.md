**Note:** This epic was superseded by [EPIC-897bbe8f](EPIC-897bbe8f), which completed the composability refactoring. The status remains `done` because the work was delivered through [EPIC-897bbe8f](EPIC-897bbe8f). The tasks listed below were not completed under this epic directly -- they were subsumed by [EPIC-897bbe8f](EPIC-897bbe8f)'s broader scope.

## Why P2

Code health for sustained velocity. Functions individually pass size limits, but file-level cohesion is poor. This is about practicing what we preach — composability is a platform principle.

## Tasks

- [ ] Extract `StreamOrchestrator` from `stream_commands.rs` (2,232 lines -> command handlers + orchestrator service)
- [ ] Implement `Tool` trait and `ToolRegistry` from `tool_executor.rs` (966 lines -> pluggable tools)
- [ ] Decompose `ConversationView.svelte` (367 lines) into smaller composable units if complexity grows
- [ ] Service layer for enforcement, governance, and scanning (wrap procedural code in structs)

## Context

Superseded by [EPIC-897bbe8f](EPIC-897bbe8f) which completed the composability refactoring — domain service extraction pattern established, `StreamOrchestrator` decomposed, `Tool` trait implemented.

## Implementation Design

Completed via [EPIC-897bbe8f](EPIC-897bbe8f).
