## What

Extend the pre-commit hook with five new validation checks for previously self-compliance-only rules.

## How

Add check functions to the pre-commit hook chain for each pattern: invalid status transitions, project.json paths not matching disk, missing pillar alignment sections in docs, deletion of research/task files, and missing TS interfaces for new Tauri commands.

## Verification

Completed as part of [EPIC-4e6e9eae](EPIC-4e6e9eae) Phase 2.

## Lessons

No new lessons.
