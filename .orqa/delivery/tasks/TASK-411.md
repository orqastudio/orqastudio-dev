title: Add stop event handling to rule-engine.mjs
description: "Extend the plugin's rule engine to evaluate enforcement entries with event: stop. Currently only file/bash events are processed. Stop events need different context (session-level, no file path) and must fire when the Stop hook runs."

acceptance:
  - rule-engine.mjs accepts and evaluates stop event context
  - Hard filter on line 199 expanded to include stop events
  - Stop hook (hooks.json) calls rule-engine.mjs in addition to stop-checklist.sh
  - RULE-532100d9 stop enforcement entries (warn + inject) fire during Stop hook
  - RULE-98682b5e stop enforcement entries fire during Stop hook
  - "Stop event context shape documented (no file_path, session-level only)"

## Scope

### rule-engine.mjs Changes

1. **Expand tool filter** (line 199): Add stop event detection — when called from Stop hook, process stop-type enforcement entries
2. **Stop event context**: No `file_path`, no `new_text`. Context is session-level: the hook receives `transcript` field per EPIC-3a8ad459 design
3. **Evaluate stop entries**: Filter enforcement entries by `event: stop`, match against session context, return verdicts

### hooks.json Changes

Update Stop hook to call both scripts:
```json
"Stop": [{
  "matcher": "*",
  "hooks": [
    { "type": "command", "command": "node rule-engine.mjs --event stop" },
    { "type": "command", "command": "bash stop-checklist.sh" }
  ]
}]
```

### Testing

- Manually verify RULE-532100d9 stop entries fire by simulating a stop event
- Verify stop-checklist.sh still runs independently
