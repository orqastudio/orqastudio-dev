title: Plugin architecture for verification data collection
description: "Plugins that provide skill + hooks + data collection for enforcement tooling. Each plugin closes the enforcement-verification loop: the same plugin that enforces also provides metrics for automated verification."

research-needed:
  - Plugin data collection API design — how plugins expose metrics endpoints
  - VER-NNN record schema and storage (file vs SQLite based on volume)
  - Parameter comparison engine — how automated pass/fail works

## Motivation

[AD-a76663db](AD-a76663db) defines enforcement tooling as plugins providing three capabilities: skill (how the tool works), data collection (metrics for automated verification), and enforcement (hooks). OrqaStudio core provides the interfaces; plugins provide the specifics. This idea covers building those interfaces.
