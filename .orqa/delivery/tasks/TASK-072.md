## What

Existing artifacts were created before body templates existed. Many are missing required sections or have content that doesn't follow the template structure.

## How

Run the body template linter against all artifacts. For each failure, add the missing section with appropriate content. Where existing content covers the topic but under a different heading, reorganise it.

## Verification

- `git add . && node .githooks/validate-schema.mjs` passes with zero body template errors
- Spot-check 5 artifacts per type to verify sections have real content
