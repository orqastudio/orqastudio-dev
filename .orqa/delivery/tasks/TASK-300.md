## What

Final sweep to update every path reference across the entire codebase after directory reorganization.

## How

1. Run `node tools/verify-links.mjs` to find remaining broken references
2. Search Rust code for old paths (.orqa/process/, .orqa/process/, .orqa/delivery/)
3. Search TypeScript code for old paths
4. Search all .orqa/ artifacts for old paths
5. Fix each reference
6. Re-run verify-links until clean

## Verification

- `make verify` passes clean
- grep for old paths returns zero results
- All symlinks resolve correctly
