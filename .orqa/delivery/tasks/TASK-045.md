acceptance:
  - Hooks section in governance displays existing hook files from .orqa/process/hooks/
  - If hooks directory contains shell scripts (not .md files)
  - they are still listed with their filename as label
  - Consider whether Claude hooks from .claude/settings.json should also surface here (may defer to IDEA-52c65fc8)

## Findings Addressed

- **F28**: Hooks section shows empty despite hook files existing

## Investigation Needed

The scanner in `artifact_reader.rs` scans for `.md` files. If `.orqa/process/hooks/` contains `.sh` files (shell scripts), they won't be found. Need to either:
1. Scan for all file types in hooks directory, or
2. Create `.md` wrapper files for each hook with frontmatter describing the hook, or
3. Defer hooks display to [IDEA-52c65fc8](IDEA-52c65fc8) (hooks system research)

Check what files actually exist in `.orqa/process/hooks/` first.
