## What

Mapped the Svelte component hierarchy from the UX wireframes, classifying each component as a page, container, or pure display component and documenting store bindings and prop flow.

## How

Walked each wireframe and identified the component decomposition, applied the purity rule (only pages and containers invoke stores or call IPC), and explicitly documented which stores each container reads from.

## Verification

Component tree documentation maps to all wireframes, purity classification is applied throughout, and store bindings are explicitly listed for every container component.
