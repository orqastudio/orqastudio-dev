## Why P1

Implementation agents build to UX specifications. Without the UX design, the scaffold (Phase 1) has no spec to follow.

## What Was Done

- Design system — typography, colour palette, spacing scale, iconography conventions
- Wireframes — core layout, conversation view, artifact browser, settings and onboarding, dashboard
- Component inventory — all reusable UI components with their states and variants
- Interaction patterns — how the user navigates, creates, edits, and deletes artifacts
- Responsive behaviour — how the layout adapts across window sizes

## Output

All UX design documentation in `.orqa/documentation/reference/`.

## Notes

Retroactively captured. Work preceded the artifact framework. UX specs govern all subsequent frontend implementation.

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
