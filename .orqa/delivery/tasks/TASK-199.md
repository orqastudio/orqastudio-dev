## What

When the rule engine encounters an enforcement entry with `action: inject` and
a `skills` array, it reads the specified SKILL.md files from `.orqa/process/skills/`
and returns their content as `systemMessage`.

## How

1. In `rule-engine.mjs`, add inject action handling alongside block/warn
2. Read SKILL.md files from `$projectDir/.orqa/process/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. Concatenate skill content into a single systemMessage
4. Track injected skills per session via a state file to prevent re-injection
5. Return systemMessage via stdout (exit 0, like warn)

## Verification

- Enforcement entry with `action: inject, skills: [orqa-ipc-patterns]` returns skill content
- Same skill not re-injected in subsequent calls within the same session
- Missing skill files are silently skipped (not a fatal error)
