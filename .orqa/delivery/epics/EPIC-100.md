# EPIC-100: Validation Consolidation — libs/validation Crate as Single Source of Truth

## Problem

OrqaStudio has 6 validation implementations that produce different results. The app's `integrity_engine.rs` has 13 checks. The MCP server has a manual copy missing 2. The LSP has 8 file-level checks. The hook has its own JS parser. The graph visualiser computes metrics in a separate JS pipeline. The CLI depends on the app being alive.

When you run `orqa validate` and get 5 errors, then open the dashboard and see 3, and then look at the graph and see 12 orphans — all from the same artifact graph — none of those numbers are trustworthy. This is an enforcement gap: the product exists to make governance reliable, and its own governance reporting is inconsistent.

## Design

See AD-062 for the architecture decision.

### Phase 1 — Extract: Create libs/validation

Create `libs/validation` as a Rust workspace crate. Extract `app/integrity_engine.rs` as the starting implementation. Organise into `checks/` modules:

| Module | Checks |
|--------|--------|
| `structural.rs` | Broken references, missing inverses, type constraints |
| `cardinality.rs` | Min/max relationship counts per relationship type |
| `cycles.rs` | Cycle detection in the relationship graph |
| `status.rs` | Valid status transitions, terminal state rules |
| `delivery.rs` | Delivery path completeness (tasks → epics → milestones) |
| `parent_child.rs` | Parent-child consistency, orphan detection |
| `body_refs.rs` | Body-text reference validation against known artifact IDs |

Add graph-theoretic metrics (currently only in JS Cytoscape pipeline):

- Connected component / cluster detection
- Orphan nodes (degree 0)
- In-degree and out-degree per node
- PageRank approximation for artifact importance

Single output type throughout: `IntegrityCheck { category, severity, message, artifact_id, auto_fixable }`.

### Phase 2 — Consolidate App + MCP

App and MCP server import from `libs/validation` as a workspace dependency. Remove their independent implementations:

- Delete `backend/src-tauri/src/integrity_engine.rs`
- Delete `libs/mcp-server/src/integrity.rs`

Verify the app's `graph_validate` Tauri command and the MCP `graph_validate` tool both produce identical output for the same artifact graph.

### Phase 3 — Consolidate LSP + Hook

LSP server imports graph-level checks from `libs/validation`. The 8 LSP file-level checks become a subset of the shared implementation — no separate logic maintained.

`validate-artifact.mjs` hook delegates to MCP `graph_validate` instead of its own JS YAML parser. The hook becomes a thin adapter: call the tool, interpret the result, report to the pre-commit pipeline.

### Phase 3.5 — Fix Graph Visualiser

The graph visualiser view is currently broken or extremely slow with no loading indicator. Before integrating server-computed metrics, the visualiser must work reliably:

1. **Diagnose and fix the loading issue** — determine if it's a data loading problem (slow Tauri command), rendering problem (Cytoscape choking on 1200+ nodes), or a missing loading state
2. **Add proper loading spinner** — show `LoadingSpinner` while graph data loads and Cytoscape initialises
3. **Fix any regressions from the skill→knowledge rename** — the `unusedSkills` → `unusedKnowledge` rename in `analysis.ts` and `types.ts` may have broken type references in consuming components
4. **Performance optimisation** — if 1200+ nodes is too many for Cytoscape, implement progressive loading or level-of-detail rendering

### Phase 4 — Metrics Integration

Graph visualiser calls server-computed metrics from `libs/validation` (via MCP) instead of running its own Cytoscape analysis. Dashboard clarity view and graph visualiser show identical numbers because they query the same source.

**Dashboard widgets** (Clarity column) — high-level health for glancing:
- Overall health score (traffic light)
- Trend over time (store health snapshots, show trend lines for key metrics)
- Threshold alerts (orphan % > 5%, clusters > 3, traceability < 90%)
- Action buttons (scan, auto-fix)
- Store health snapshots in SQLite (the app already uses SQLite for conversation persistence — per AD-2aa4d6db, metrics are structured queryable data, appropriate for SQLite)
- Expand snapshots to capture all metrics, not just error/warning counts
- Trend queries: metric values over time, deltas between snapshots

**Graph visualiser health panel** — detailed metrics for investigating:
- Full metric breakdown with values and traffic-light status per metric
- Per-artifact drilldowns (which nodes are orphans, bottlenecks, disconnected)
- Cluster visualisation (colour-code nodes by connected component)
- Pillar traceability tree (which artifacts trace to which pillars, and which don't)
- Historical comparison (metric deltas since last snapshot)

Both surfaces consume the same `libs/validation` data — dashboard summarises, visualiser explores.

Expand graph-theoretic metrics beyond current set:

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Connected components | Fragmentation — should be 1 |
| Orphan count/% | Unreachable artifacts |
| Average degree | Interconnectedness |
| Graph density | Actual edges / possible edges |
| Betweenness centrality | Bottleneck artifacts — critical bridges |
| Clustering coefficient | Local cohesion — do related artifacts form tight groups |
| Eigenvector centrality | Influence — nodes connected to important nodes |
| Pillar traceability % | % of artifacts traceable to at least one pillar (RULE-031) |
| Bidirectionality ratio | % of relationships with proper inverses |
| Staleness/currency | Age of active artifacts, stale items detection |
| Schema completeness | % of artifacts with all required fields |
| Relationship completeness | % with expected relationship types for their type |

### Phase 5 — Rebuild Relationships and Traceability UI

Rebuild the artifact relationships and traceability components from scratch using the graph metrics and validation data from `libs/validation`.

**Traceability view** — the core feature: show how any artifact traces back to the vision through the pillar hierarchy. For any selected artifact, render the full provenance chain:

```
Vision → Pillar → Idea → Research → Decision → Epic → Task (you are here)
                              ↓
                          Rule → Knowledge → Agent
```

This is not just "show relationships" — it's "show how this work evolved from a pillar, through ideation, into implementation." Each node in the chain is clickable, showing the decision points and context that led to the current artifact.

**Relationships panel rebuild:**
1. **Ancestry chain** — trace UP from any artifact to its pillar(s) via BFS. Show the full path with relationship types. If no path exists, flag it as disconnected from governance.
2. **Descendant tree** — trace DOWN from any artifact to see everything it spawned (epic → tasks, decision → rules, etc.)
3. **Sibling context** — other artifacts at the same level that share the same parent (other tasks in the same epic, other rules enforcing the same decision)
4. **Cross-cutting relationships** — documents, synchronised-with, employs — relationships that bridge between the governance and delivery hierarchies
5. **Impact radius** — what would be affected if this artifact changed (using the `computeImpact` function with configurable depth)

**Full graph layout:**
- Replace `cose-bilkent` (force-directed, produces a ball) with `dagre` (hierarchical DAG layout)
- Vision/Pillars as root nodes at the top, flow downward through the governance hierarchy
- Hierarchy levels by artifact type: vision(0) → pillar(1) → idea(2) → decision/research(3) → epic/rule(4) → task/knowledge(5)
- Edge direction follows the governance flow (grounded-by, drives, delivers, enforces)
- Cross-cutting edges (documents, synchronised-with) rendered as lighter/dotted to not dominate the hierarchy

**Visual design:**
- Use the graph visualiser's existing Cytoscape infrastructure for rendering
- Ancestry chain rendered as a vertical timeline (pillar at top, current artifact highlighted)
- Descendants as an expandable tree
- Cross-cutting links shown as dotted connections to the side
- Disconnected artifacts shown with a warning indicator and a "connect to pillar" action
- Layout switchable between hierarchical (default) and force-directed (exploration)

### Phase 6 — Auto-Fix and Enforcement

The validation library provides auto-fix methods for objective issues:

**Auto-fixable (no human judgment needed):**
- Missing inverse relationship → add the inverse to target artifact
- Broken ref from known rename (SKILL→KNOW) → update the ID
- Missing `type:` field → infer from path registry + core.json
- Missing `status:` field → set `captured`
- Duplicate relationship entries → deduplicate
- Bidirectionality gaps → add the missing direction

**Not auto-fixable (flag for human review):**
- Which pillar an idea should ground to
- Which epic an unassigned task belongs to
- Whether an orphan should be archived or connected

API: `validate()` returns checks, `auto_fix()` applies objective fixes, remainder is reported for review.

**Enforcement integration:**
- PreToolUse hook: block artifact creation without minimum relationships
- Pre-commit hook: `orqa validate --fix` auto-heals, fails on remaining errors
- Dashboard: threshold alerts when metrics cross boundaries (orphan % > 5%, clusters > 3, traceability < 90%)

The graph self-heals on every commit. Human review is only needed for subjective decisions.

## Risks

- **Type interface design** — shared types between app, MCP, and LSP need careful design to avoid circular workspace dependencies
- **LSP file-level vs graph-level checks** — some LSP checks are inherently per-file (can run without loading the full graph); the interface must support both modes
- **Hook MCP dependency** — the hook now requires the MCP server to be running; validate this is always the case in the pre-commit environment
- **Metric algorithm parity** — JS Cytoscape and Rust graph metrics may use different algorithms; parity must be verified before deleting the JS pipeline
