## What

Built the sidecar process management layer in Rust, parsing NDJSON output and emitting streaming events to the Svelte frontend via Tauri's `Channel<T>`.

## How

Implemented process spawning with `tauri-plugin-shell`, line-by-line NDJSON parsing from stdout, and a `Channel<T>` emitter that forwards typed stream events to the frontend in real-time.

## Verification

Sidecar starts on demand, streams NDJSON events through the channel to the frontend, and cleans up on process death or timeout.
