## What

Update the `core.json` schema to rename the `skill` artifact type to `knowledge` and change the `idPrefix` from `SKILL` to `KNOW`. This is the foundational schema change that all other rename tasks depend on.

## How

Locate the artifact type definition for `skill` in `core.json` and update:
- `type: "skill"` → `type: "knowledge"`
- `idPrefix: "SKILL"` → `idPrefix: "KNOW"`
- Update any `label`, `plural`, or display name fields accordingly
- Update the directory path reference if hardcoded (`skills/` → `knowledge/`)

## Verification

1. `orqa validate schema` passes on `core.json`
2. The `knowledge` type appears in `orqa graph` type listings
3. No references to the old `skill` type remain in `core.json`
4. Other tasks (Rust types, TS types, mass rename) can proceed using this as the source of truth
