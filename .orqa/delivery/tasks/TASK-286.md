## What

Create an architecture decision documenting the directory reorganization from governance/team/planning to process/delivery/documentation.

## How

1. Create `.orqa/process/decisions/[AD-71d44f5c](AD-71d44f5c).md`
2. Document: current structure, target structure, rationale, migration approach
3. Define the first-class artifact principle formally

## Verification

- [AD-71d44f5c](AD-71d44f5c) exists and passes schema validation
- Decision clearly maps old paths to new paths
