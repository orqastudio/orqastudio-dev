## What

Create [RULE-92dba0cb](RULE-92dba0cb) that governs how agent capabilities map to provider-specific tools.
This is the foundation that [EPIC-3a8ad459](EPIC-3a8ad459) (companion plugin) and all future provider
integrations will consume.

## How

1. Define the abstract capability vocabulary as a table
2. Define the Claude Code CLI mapping table
3. Define the OrqaStudio App mapping table
4. Specify the delegation protocol: before spawning any subagent, resolve capabilities
   to the current context's tool names
5. Specify context detection: CLI = Claude Code native tools available; App = Tauri
   commands available

## Verification

- Rule file exists at `.orqa/process/rules/[RULE-92dba0cb](RULE-92dba0cb).md`
- Frontmatter passes schema validation
- All current agent tool lists can be expressed using the capability vocabulary
- No capability is ambiguous or overlapping
