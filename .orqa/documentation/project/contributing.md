# Contributing to OrqaStudio

The canonical contribution guide lives at the dev repo root: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md). This doc covers the governance-specific aspects.

## Key Principles

1. **All work goes through the dev repo** — never clone individual repos. Pre-commit hooks enforce integrity, version sync, licenses, and READMEs.

2. **DCO, not CLA** — sign off commits with `git commit -s`. You retain copyright.

3. **Three pillars** — features must serve at least one: Clarity Through Structure, Learning Through Reflection, or Purpose Through Continuity.

4. **Ethical licensing** — contributions are licensed under BSL-1.1 with an Ethical Use Addendum that protects marginalised communities. See AD-fc646168.

## Contributing Governance Artifacts

When adding or modifying `.orqa/` artifacts:

- Run `orqa verify` before committing — zero errors is the baseline
- New artifacts need required relationships per the schema (`grounded`, `benefits`, `enforces`, `upholds`)
- Use canonical relationship vocabulary from `core.json`
- Doc/skill pairs must be connected via `synchronised-with`
- Docs need a `category` field (reference, how-to, architecture, concept, onboarding)

## Multi-Repo PR Process

Changes often span multiple submodules. Submit PRs in dependency order:

1. **Types** (`libs/types`) — merge first if schema changes
2. **CLI** (`libs/cli`) — merge after types if validator changes
3. **App** (`app`) — merge after dependencies
4. **Dev repo** — merge last, updates all submodule pointers

Use the same branch name across all affected repos. The dev repo PR lists all submodule PRs.

## Quality Gate

`orqa verify` must pass before any PR is mergeable:
- `orqa validate` — artifact graph integrity
- `orqa version check` — no version drift
- `orqa repo license` — correct licenses per policy
- `orqa repo readme` — banner, badges, sections present
