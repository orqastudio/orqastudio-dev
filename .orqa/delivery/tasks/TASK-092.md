## What

Ensured cross-reference integrity across the newly created decision artifacts and updated the roadmap to reflect completed work.

## How

Searched all AD-NNN.md files for research-refs and supersession references. Fixed broken links. Updated roadmap.md and [MS-654badde](MS-654badde).md.

## Verification

No broken cross-references. Roadmap accurately reflects completed milestones and epics.
