## What

The Stop hook replaces the shell-script pre-commit reminder. When the agent is
about to stop, it injects a checklist reminding the agent to commit, update
session state, and clean up.

## How

1. Create `hooks/stop.md` hook definition
2. On Stop event, build pre-commit checklist from governance rules
3. Return checklist as additionalContext

## Verification

- Agent stop shows pre-commit checklist
- Removing `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-reminder.sh` doesn't lose functionality
