title: Build AI-assisted backfill and link verification tooling
description: "Build tooling that reads artifacts, proposes relationship connections based on content analysis, presents for human review, and batch-updates frontmatter. Includes link verification tooling that scans artifact content for contextual accuracy of cross-references. Reusable for future schema migrations. Usage documented as an injectable skill."

acceptance:
  - Backfill tool reads an artifact and identifies required relationship types from schema
  - Backfill tool searches other artifacts for likely connections (semantic search or content analysis)
  - Backfill tool proposes relationships with draft rationale
  - "Human can approve, reject, or edit each proposal"
  - Backfill tool updates artifact frontmatter with approved relationships
  - Backfill tool tracks processed vs pending artifacts
  - Safe frontmatter editing — markdown body is never corrupted
  - Link verification tool scans all artifact content (not just frontmatter) for cross-references
  - "Link verification uses pattern matching for structural checks (broken refs, missing targets)"
  - "Link verification uses AI for contextual accuracy (does the reference make sense in context?)"
  - "Link verification produces a report of broken, missing, and contextually inaccurate links"
  - An injectable skill is created documenting how to use both tools

## What

Two complementary tools for the migration:

1. **Backfill tool** — reads artifacts, analyses content, proposes relationship connections, presents for review, updates frontmatter. Reusable for any future schema evolution.
2. **Link verification tool** — scans all artifact content for cross-references and validates them structurally (target exists, format correct) and contextually (reference makes sense given the content). Uses pattern matching for structural checks and AI for contextual accuracy.
3. **Injectable skill** — documents how agents should use both tools, injected into any agent performing migration or audit work.

## How

### Backfill Tool

1. For each artifact type, read the schema to know which relationship types are required
2. For each artifact, use semantic search to find likely connection targets
3. Generate proposed relationships with draft rationale based on content overlap
4. Present proposals to user in batches (per artifact type)
5. User approves/rejects/edits each proposal
6. Update frontmatter YAML safely (parse, modify, serialize — don't regex)
7. Track progress in a migration state file

### Link Verification Tool

1. Scan all `.orqa/**/*.md` files for cross-references (pattern: `[Display](ARTIFACT-ID)`, bare `ARTIFACT-ID`, frontmatter reference fields)
2. Structural checks (pattern matching): target artifact exists, ID format is valid, no broken refs, bidirectional consistency (if A references B, B should reference A where applicable)
3. Contextual checks (AI-assisted): does the reference make sense given the content of both artifacts? Is a rule referencing a decision that's actually related to its enforcement domain?
4. Produce a structured report: broken links, missing targets, contextually suspect references
5. Optionally propose fixes for broken/suspect links

### Skill

1. Create an injectable skill documenting usage of both tools
2. Include when to use each tool, expected inputs/outputs, and integration with migration workflow

## Verification

- Backfill: run against a small sample (3-5 artifacts) and verify proposals are reasonable
- Backfill: verify frontmatter updates don't corrupt markdown body
- Backfill: verify progress tracking works across sessions
- Link verification: run against full artifact set and verify it catches known broken links
- Link verification: verify AI contextual checks flag genuinely suspect references
- Skill: verify skill loads correctly and provides useful guidance to agents
