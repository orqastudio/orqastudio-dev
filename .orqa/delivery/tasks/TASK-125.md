## What

Set up the SQLite database layer with connection management, initial schema for sessions, messages, and tool calls, and a migration runner for schema evolution.

## How

Used `rusqlite` with a migration runner that applies versioned SQL files in order. Defined repository traits and concrete implementations following the project's repository pattern.

## Verification

Database is created and migrated on first launch, schema matches spec, and repository implementations pass their unit tests.
