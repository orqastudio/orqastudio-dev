## What

Recorded four architecture decisions establishing the persistence strategy, file-based governance format, data ownership boundaries, and configuration management approach.

## How

Authored each AD artifact with full context and rationale, ensuring the SQLite/file-based split was clearly articulated and cross-referenced across the four decisions.

## Verification

[AD-5d9ac6bd](AD-5d9ac6bd) through [AD-8b91f5a4](AD-8b91f5a4) exist in `.orqa/process/decisions/` with all required schema fields and are listed in the decisions index.
