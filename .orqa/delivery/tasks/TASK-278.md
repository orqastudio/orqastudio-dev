## What

Now that all ~150 artifacts have been backfilled, make the new fields required. From this point forward, no artifact can be created without relationships.

## How

1. Update all four governance schema.json files — move new fields into `required`
2. Run full validation against all existing artifacts to confirm none fail
3. Update orchestrator prompt (CLAUDE.md / orchestrator.md) with relationship guidance
4. Update relevant skills (orqa-schema-compliance, governance-maintenance)

## Verification

- `make check` passes (pre-commit hook validates all staged artifacts)
- Create a test artifact without relationships — validation rejects it
- Create a test artifact with relationships — validation passes
