## Scope

### tao Event Loop Warnings (Finding #34)
- **Symptoms**: Dev controller floods with:
  - `WARN tao::platform_impl::platform::event_loop::runner: NewEvents emitted without explicit RedrawEventsCleared`
  - `WARN tao::platform_impl::platform::event_loop::runner: RedrawEventsCleared emitted without explicit MainEventsCleared`
- **Investigation**: Is this a known tao/Tauri issue? Does it affect Windows specifically? Is there a version fix?
- **Resolution options**:
  1. Upgrade tao/wry if a fix exists
  2. Filter WARN-level tao logs in dev controller
  3. Document as known framework noise if harmless
