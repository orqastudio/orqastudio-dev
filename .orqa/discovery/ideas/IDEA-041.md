title: Centralised error surfacing to the frontend
description: "Ensure all backend errors, failed invokes, and silent promise rejections are surfaced visibly to the user. No error should be silently swallowed — every failure should either appear in a toast, status indicator, or error panel."

horizon: next
research-needed:
  - Audit all invoke() call sites for void/fire-and-forget patterns that swallow errors
  - "Design a centralised error notification system (toast queue, error log panel, or both)"
  - Determine which errors are user-actionable vs informational
  - Evaluate Svelte 5 error boundary patterns for component-level error catching
  - "Review Tauri event-based error propagation for backend errors that aren't invoke responses"

## Motivation

During dogfooding, multiple issues were discovered where errors were silently swallowed:

- `void artifactGraphSDK.initialize()` discards the promise, hiding any error from the user
- Backend failures during graph building show as a stuck spinner with no error message
- Fire-and-forget patterns (`void someAsyncCall()`) throughout the codebase mean errors vanish

Users need to see what went wrong so they can take action (retry, report, fix config). Silent failures create confusion and erode trust — "is the app broken or just slow?"

## Sketch

### Error Classification

| Category | Examples | Surface as |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **User-actionable** | No project open, file not found, permission denied | Toast with action button |
| **Transient** | Network timeout, lock contention | Toast with auto-retry option |
| **Informational** | Graph build warnings, scan skipped files | Error log panel (non-blocking) |
| **Fatal** | Database corruption, sidecar crash | Full-screen error with recovery steps |

### Possible Approaches

1. **Global error handler**: Catch unhandled promise rejections at the app level, route to a toast system
2. **Invoke wrapper enhancement**: The `$lib/ipc/invoke.ts` wrapper could emit errors to a global error store
3. **Error log panel**: A collapsible panel in the UI showing recent errors with timestamps
4. **Status bar indicators**: Like the index button error state — each subsystem shows its health in the status bar
