## What

[RULE-89155a7f](RULE-89155a7f) (Tooltip Usage) has `scope: software-engineering` which is not in the documented valid value set (`system | domain | project | role | artifact`). Fix to use the correct value.

## How

1. Read [RULE-89155a7f](RULE-89155a7f) to understand its scope — it enforces shadcn Tooltip usage over native `title` attributes
2. Determine the correct scope: likely `project` (specific to this codebase's UI conventions) or `domain` (applies to any project using shadcn)
3. Update the frontmatter `scope` field

## Verification

- [ ] [RULE-89155a7f](RULE-89155a7f) scope field uses a value from the valid set
- [ ] Value accurately reflects the rule's applicability
