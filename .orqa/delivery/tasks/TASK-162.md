title: Remove outer wrapping parentheses from artifact links
description: "Strip surrounding parentheses/brackets from artifact links across all .orqa/ markdown files — change ([EPIC-e045ab6d](EPIC-e045ab6d)) to [EPIC-e045ab6d](EPIC-e045ab6d). The markdown links themselves stay as-is."

## What

Many artifact links across `.orqa/` files are wrapped in unnecessary outer parentheses: `([EPIC-e045ab6d](EPIC-e045ab6d))`. The markdown link format `[EPIC-e045ab6d](EPIC-e045ab6d)` is correct and should stay, but the surrounding parentheses add visual noise in both raw markdown and rendered output.

## How

1. Search all `.orqa/` markdown files for the pattern `([ID](ID))` where ID matches artifact prefixes
2. Replace with `[ID](ID)` — removing only the outer wrapping parentheses
3. Skip research files with `status: surpassed` per [RULE-6d1c8dc7](RULE-6d1c8dc7) (historical records are immutable)
4. Verify no links were broken by the replacement

## Verification

- [ ] No `([ID](ID))` patterns remain in active .orqa/ files
- [ ] All `[ID](ID)` markdown links still resolve correctly
- [ ] Surpassed research files are unchanged
- [ ] Consistent format across all artifact types
