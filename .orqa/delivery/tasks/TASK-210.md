title: Backfill skills field on existing tasks from injection table
description: "Populate the skills field on existing todo tasks using the orchestrator's current Tier 2 injection table, transferring injection logic from the prompt to the graph."
status: completed

acceptance:
  - All todo tasks have a skills field (may be empty array if no specific skills needed)
  - Skills entries match existing skill names in .orqa/process/skills/
  - "Injection table knowledge is now encoded in the graph, not the prompt"

## What

Transfer the orchestrator's hardcoded Tier 2 skill injection table into graph edges on individual tasks. Instead of the orchestrator looking up "task touches backend/src-tauri/ → inject backend-best-practices", the task itself declares `skills: [backend-best-practices, tauri-v2]`.

## How

1. Read the current Tier 2 injection table from `orchestrator.md`
2. For each todo task, match its `scope` file paths against the injection table
3. Add matching skills to the task's `skills:` array
4. Verify all skill names resolve to existing skills in `.orqa/process/skills/`

## Verification

- All todo tasks have a `skills` field (array of strings or empty array)
- All skill names resolve to directories in `.orqa/process/skills/`
- Tasks touching `backend/src-tauri/` have backend skills (backend-best-practices, etc.)
- Tasks touching `ui/` have frontend skills (svelte5-best-practices, etc.)
- Tasks touching `.orqa/` have governance skills (orqa-governance, etc.)
