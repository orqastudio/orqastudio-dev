**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Phase:** 2b
**Status:** Implemented

## Overview

When a user opens a project in OrqaStudio™, the AI provider (via the Agent SDK sidecar) scans existing governance files, analyzes their coverage and quality, and generates recommendations for improvements. The output is governance artifacts written to `.orqa/` — the canonical source of truth for all governance files in an OrqaStudio-managed project. A `.claude/` symlink compatibility layer may co-exist to support CLI tools that expect governance files at `.claude/`.

The governance bootstrap is the bridge between "project has some governance" and "project has comprehensive, enforceable governance." It requires AI analysis because static analysis cannot understand intent, detect gaps in coverage, or generate contextually appropriate rules.

## Why AI Analysis, Not a Static Scanner

A static scanner can count files and check formats. AI analysis can:

- **Read and understand** governance files — detect what a rule actually enforces vs. what it claims to
- **Detect gaps** — identify areas of the codebase with no governance coverage (e.g., testing standards exist but no error handling rules)
- **Suggest improvements** — generate rules, hooks, and agent definitions tailored to the project's tech stack and domain
- **Translate formats** — convert Cursor rules, Copilot instructions, or Continue configs into OrqaStudio governance artifacts
- **Generate tech-stack-specific content** — a Rust project gets different rules than a Python project

## Scan Sources

The governance scanner walks the filesystem to collect governance files from multiple tool ecosystems.

| Source | Path Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| OrqaStudio rules | `.orqa/process/rules/*.md` | Enforcement rules (canonical location) |
| OrqaStudio agents | `.orqa/process/agents/*.md` | Agent role definitions (canonical location) |
| OrqaStudio skills | `.orqa/process/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions (canonical location) |
| OrqaStudio hooks | `.orqa/process/hooks/*` | Session hooks (canonical location) |
| OrqaStudio settings | `.orqa/settings.json` | Hook configuration, permissions (canonical location) |
| CLI compat rules | `.claude/rules/*.md` | Symlink layer for CLI tools (if present) |
| CLI compat agents | `.claude/agents/*.md` | Symlink layer for CLI tools (if present) |
| Project instructions | `.orqa/INSTRUCTIONS.md` or root `AGENTS.md` (CLI compat: `CLAUDE.md`) | Project-level AI instructions |
| Cursor rules | `.cursor/rules/*.md`, `.cursorrules` | Cursor AI rules (translatable) |
| Copilot instructions | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot instructions (translatable) |
| Continue config | `.continue/` | Continue IDE extension config (translatable) |

## Output: `.orqa/` Governance Artifacts

The governance bootstrap writes governance artifacts to `.orqa/` — the source of truth for OrqaStudio-managed projects. Artifacts use open, text-based formats (Markdown, shell scripts, JSON) so they:

- Can be edited with any text editor
- Are portable and version-controllable
- Work with CLI tools via the optional `.claude/` symlink compatibility layer

| Artifact Type | Output Path | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Rules | `.orqa/process/rules/*.md` | Enforcement rules |
| Hooks | `.orqa/process/hooks/*.sh` | Session and pre-commit hooks |
| Agents | `.orqa/process/agents/*.md` | Agent role definitions |
| Skills | `.orqa/process/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions |
| Settings | `.orqa/settings.json` | Hook registration and permissions |
| Project instructions | `.orqa/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Project-level AI instructions |
| Cross-agent instructions | `AGENTS.md` | Cross-agent instructions (root, tool-agnostic) |

## Sidecar Integration

The governance bootstrap uses the existing `send_message` flow with a dedicated "governance" session. No new sidecar request types are needed — it is a specialized system prompt that instructs the AI provider to analyze governance files and produce structured output.

**Flow:**
1. Rust backend collects governance files via filesystem walk
2. File contents are formatted into a structured prompt
3. A governance session is created with a system prompt instructing the AI to analyze and recommend
4. The AI response is parsed into structured recommendations
5. Recommendations are stored in SQLite for review

The system prompt instructs the AI to return recommendations in a structured JSON format within a code block, which Rust parses into `Recommendation` objects.

## Wizard Flow

### Trigger Conditions

The governance bootstrap wizard appears when a project is opened and meets one of these conditions:

- **First open:** No governance analysis exists for this project in SQLite
- **Sparse governance:** The scan finds fewer than 3 governance areas covered (e.g., has rules but no agents, hooks, or skills)
- **Manual trigger:** User clicks "Re-analyze" on the project dashboard

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Project opens** — Rust backend automatically scans the filesystem for governance files
2. **Sparse detection** — If fewer than 3 governance areas have files, the wizard overlay appears
3. **Scan panel** — Displays findings: which files were found, which areas are covered, a coverage indicator (e.g., "3 of 7 areas covered")
4. **"Analyze"** — User clicks to start the AI-powered analysis. Creates a governance session via the sidecar
5. **Analysis results** — The AI returns structured analysis: strengths, gaps, and recommendations. Displayed in a review panel
6. **Review panel** — Each recommendation is a card showing: category, priority, title, description, target file path, and content preview. User can approve, reject, or edit each recommendation
7. **Conversational refinement** — User can send follow-up messages in the governance session to refine recommendations (e.g., "Make that rule stricter" or "We don't use Playwright, use Vitest instead")
8. **Apply** — Approved recommendations are written to disk as native files. OrqaStudio calls `fs::write` for each approved artifact
9. **Done** — Dashboard updated with new governance health status

## User Journeys

**New project with no governance:**
1. User opens a project directory with no `.orqa/` governance files
2. Scan finds 0 governance files — wizard appears automatically
3. Scan panel shows "No governance files found. 0 of 7 areas covered."
4. User clicks "Analyze" to start AI-powered analysis
5. The AI analyzes the project's package.json, Cargo.toml, etc. to understand the tech stack
6. The AI generates recommendations: coding standards rule, error handling rule, testing rule, pre-commit hook, etc.
7. User reviews each recommendation — approves most, rejects one, edits another via chat
8. User clicks "Apply" — files written to `.orqa/rules/`, `.orqa/process/hooks/`, etc.
9. Dashboard shows governance health: "5 of 7 areas covered"

**Existing project with Cursor rules:**
1. User opens a project with `.cursorrules` and some `.cursor/rules/*.md`
2. Scan finds Cursor-format rules — wizard appears (OrqaStudio governance not yet configured)
3. Scan panel shows: "Found 4 Cursor rules. OrqaStudio governance: 0 of 7 areas covered."
4. User clicks "Analyze"
5. The AI reads the Cursor rules, understands their intent, and generates equivalent OrqaStudio governance rules
6. Recommendations include translated rules plus additional gap-filling suggestions
7. User reviews, approves, applies

**Existing project with comprehensive governance:**
1. User opens the OrqaStudio project itself (which has extensive `.orqa/` governance)
2. Scan finds 20+ files across all 7 areas
3. Coverage is 7/7 — wizard does NOT auto-trigger
4. User can still click "Re-analyze" on the dashboard to get improvement suggestions

## Verification Criteria

1. **Scan accuracy:** Open a project with governance files in any supported location — scan finds all files, coverage ratio is correct
2. **Sparse trigger:** Open a project with < 3 governance areas — wizard triggers automatically
3. **AI analysis:** "Analyze" produces structured recommendations with real content (not stubs)
4. **Approve/reject:** Recommendation status changes persist in SQLite
5. **Apply writes files:** Approved recommendations create real files on disk at the specified paths
6. **Re-analyze detects changes:** After applying recommendations, re-scanning detects the new files
