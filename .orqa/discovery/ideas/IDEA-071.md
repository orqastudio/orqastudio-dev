> **Surpassed 2026-03-16**: Basic plugin ecosystem concept merged into EPIC-3f65c703 via AD-c6abc8e6. Provider-aware plugin system (provider detection, capability routing, load-time filtering) split into IDEA-c496b2de as a distinct capability layer needed for multi-model AI support.

## Motivation

[RES-cd3d33bf](RES-cd3d33bf) established the design decisions for plugin-provider pairing, capability fulfilment, and plugin type taxonomy. These decisions need implementation:

- Plugin type system (array of types, extendable enum, type-specific requires shape)
- AI provider definitions in `.orqa/providers/` (identity, detection, required plugins)
- Capability routing per-project with plugin-provided defaults and app baseline
- Plugin installation that wires capabilities, skills, and agent updates as a complete package
- Load-time filtering of non-matching plugins based on active AI provider
- Bidirectional provider-plugin relationship (providers declare required plugins, plugins declare supported providers)

This is the implementation companion to [IDEA-1c7ebe74](IDEA-1c7ebe74) (sidecar-as-plugin), which would eventually merge provider definitions into plugins themselves.
