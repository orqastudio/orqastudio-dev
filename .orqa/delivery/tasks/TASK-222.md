## What

[AD-2783985c](AD-2783985c) (graph-based knowledge injection), [AD-e8ab8572](AD-e8ab8572) (core graph firmware), and [AD-6dfbba70](AD-6dfbba70)
(task-first audit trail with configurable epic requirement) represent a significant
architectural shift. Several earlier decisions may now be:

- **Superseded**: The new decision replaces the old one entirely
- **Partially affected**: The old decision still holds but some aspects changed
- **Unaffected**: The old decision is independent of the new architecture

## Known Candidates for Review

These decisions are likely affected based on what [AD-2783985c](AD-2783985c)/039/040 change:

| Decision | Title | Likely Impact |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| [AD-53e80192](AD-53e80192) | Three-tier skill model | May be affected by graph-based skill discovery |
| [AD-774cc3d0](AD-774cc3d0) | Universal agent roles | Likely unaffected — roles are orthogonal to injection |
| [AD-2aa4d6db](AD-2aa4d6db) | SQLite for conversations only | Likely unaffected — governance stays file-based |
| [AD-0291fa65](AD-0291fa65) | Enforcement engine | May be affected by graph-based enforcement |
| [AD-89391ab6](AD-89391ab6) | Plugin architecture | May be affected by plugin reading graph |
| [AD-2f1991c2](AD-2f1991c2) | Companion plugin | Likely affected — plugin now reads graph |
| [AD-d8ea4d2b](AD-d8ea4d2b) | Rule enforcement entries | May be affected by self-enforcing rules |
| [AD-0f6286cd](AD-0f6286cd) | Capability-based agents | Likely unaffected — orthogonal to injection |

All other ADs should still be reviewed for completeness.

## How

1. Read each AD from [AD-e513c9e4](AD-e513c9e4) through [AD-0f6286cd](AD-0f6286cd)
2. Evaluate against [AD-2783985c](AD-2783985c)/039/040 changes
3. Mark superseded decisions with proper status and cross-references
4. Update both sides of any supersession in the same commit

## Verification

- All ADs reviewed and verdicts recorded in summary table below
- No one-sided supersessions
- All superseded decisions have correct status and cross-references

## Output

No full supersessions found. [AD-2783985c](AD-2783985c)/039/040 are additive/evolutionary, not replacements. Six ADs are partially affected:
