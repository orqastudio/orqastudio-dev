## What

Verify the three-tier skill loading works end-to-end by dry-running several delegation
scenarios and confirming the right skills are loaded in each case.

## Test Scenarios

1. **Backend task** (scope: `backend/src-tauri/src/commands/`) — Expect: agent loads `code-search` +
   `rust-async-patterns` (Tier 1), orchestrator injects `orqa-ipc-patterns` +
   `orqa-error-composition` + `composability` (Tier 2), `code-search` resolves to
   `chunkhound` in CLI (Tier 3)

2. **Frontend task** (scope: `ui/src/lib/stores/`) — Expect: `code-search` +
   `svelte5-best-practices` (Tier 1), `orqa-store-patterns` + `orqa-store-orchestration` +
   `composability` (Tier 2)

3. **Governance task** (scope: `.orqa/`) — Expect: `code-search` + `planning` (Tier 1),
   `orqa-governance` + `composability` (Tier 2)

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
