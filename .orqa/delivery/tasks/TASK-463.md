title: Create grounding documents for all agent roles
description: "Create 5 concise grounding documents distilled from restructured documentation. Each answers: why this role exists, what good looks like, what goes wrong under pressure. Designed for agent injection, not human browsing."

## Scope

Create `.orqa/documentation/grounding/` directory with 5 role-area documents.

Each document answers three questions:
1. **Why does this role exist?** — Connection to mission and pillars
2. **What does "good" look like?** — The principles that define quality for this role
3. **What goes wrong under pressure?** — Specific failure modes and how to recognize them

### Documents

| File | Grounds | Distilled From |
|------|---------|---------------|
| product-purpose.md | Orchestrator, Planner, Writer | VISION-001 (vision), DOC-1bc9d0b9 (governance), pillars |
| code-principles.md | Implementer, Reviewer | DOC-4b4fbc0f (coding-standards), architecture decisions |
| artifact-principles.md | Orchestrator, Writer, Researcher, Governance Steward | DOC-01ddd8aa (artifact-framework), DOC-1bc9d0b9 (governance) |
| design-principles.md | Designer | DOC-03f1dff2 (design-system), DOC-9c29d60c (interaction-patterns), DOC-ffd47d19 (personas) |
| research-principles.md | Researcher | Research methodology skill content |

### Constraints

- Maximum 50 lines per document — these are injected into agent context, not browsed
- No procedural content — grounding is about purpose and principles, not how-to
- Content must be distilled, not duplicated — reference the source docs for detail
