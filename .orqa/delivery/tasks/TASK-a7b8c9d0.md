title: Implement knowledge resolution from project.json plugin paths
description: "Implement the connector's knowledge resolution logic: at delegation time, read project.json to find plugin paths, then read knowledge files from those canonical locations."
status: ready
created: 2026-03-20
updated: 2026-03-20
acceptance:
  - Connector reads project.json to discover plugin paths at delegation time
  - Knowledge files are resolved from canonical plugin knowledge/ directories
  - No hardcoded paths to specific knowledge files
  - Resolution falls back gracefully if a plugin path is missing or unreadable
  - No unwrap() or expect() in Rust implementation; no 'any' in TypeScript

## What

Implement the knowledge resolution mechanism in the connector so that when the orchestrator needs to inject domain knowledge into a subagent, it:
1. Reads `project.json` to get the list of active plugin paths
2. For each plugin path, checks if a `knowledge/<name>/SKILL.md` (or `<name>.md`) file exists
3. Returns the content for injection into the agent's prompt

This replaces the previous model of reading from local copies.

## How

Locate the knowledge injection logic in `connectors/claude-code/` (likely in the orchestrator or a delegation helper):
- Replace static file reads with dynamic resolution via `project.json`
- Parse `project.json` to extract plugin paths (the same paths used by `orqa graph`)
- For each plugin, glob `knowledge/**/*.md` to find available knowledge files
- Expose a `resolveKnowledge(name: string): string | null` function used by the orchestrator

Error handling:
- If `project.json` is unreadable → log warning, return empty knowledge set (don't fail delegation)
- If a specific knowledge file is missing → return null for that knowledge item, don't crash

## Verification

1. Delegation with knowledge injection reads from plugin paths, not local copies
2. Adding a new knowledge file to a plugin makes it available to the connector without code changes
3. `search_regex "knowledge"` in connector source shows dynamic resolution, not hardcoded paths
4. TASK-e1f2a3b4 (end-to-end test) passes
