## What

Update the orchestrator's delegation protocol so that when delegating a task to an
agent, the delegation prompt includes the Tier 2 project skills that match the task's
scope.

## Implementation Notes

In the orchestrator's "Delegation Protocol" section, add a step between "Scope the task"
and "Provide context":

```
3. **Inject project skills** — Match the task's scope against the injection table.
   Include in the delegation prompt: "Load these project skills before starting: [list]"
```

The agent then loads these alongside its own Tier 1 skills and any Tier 3 wrapper
resolutions.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
