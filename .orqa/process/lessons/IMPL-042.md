title: Epic body drifts from actual work — no standing mechanism to maintain consistency
description: "When tasks are added, pillars updated, or scope evolves mid-epic, the epic body (task table, pillars array, docs-produced) isn't updated in sync. This causes incomplete epic bodies at closure that need manual reconciliation. A standing reconciliation task per epic would force ongoing maintenance."

## Pattern

During [EPIC-942c7678](EPIC-942c7678), work emerged mid-epic (TASK-6dab59a2 for AD memory injection, [PILLAR-94b281db](PILLAR-94b281db) creation). These were completed as tasks but the epic body wasn't updated — the task table was missing [TASK-6dab59a2](TASK-6dab59a2) and the pillars array didn't include [PILLAR-94b281db](PILLAR-94b281db). This was only caught during the manual completion review. The pattern: epic bodies drift as work evolves, and nothing enforces sync until someone notices at the end.

## Fix

Create a standing "Reconcile EPIC-NNN" task automatically when any epic is created. This task:
1. Cannot be marked done until the epic is ready to close
2. Has acceptance criteria that check epic body accuracy (task table, pillars, docs-produced, scope)
3. Depends on all other tasks in the epic (always last)
4. Forces the orchestrator to maintain epic body consistency throughout the epic lifecycle, not just at closure
