description: "Design a hooks layer that works in both app and CLI contexts, with richer lifecycle events and backwards compatibility with Claude Code hooks."
status: completed
created: 2026-03-07
updated: 2026-03-07
horizon: active
research-needed:
  - Audit current Claude hooks in .claude/settings.json and what they enforce
  - Research Claude hookify plugin as inspiration for CLI compatibility
  - Design a hooks layer that works in both app and CLI contexts
  - "Define hook lifecycle (pre-commit, session-start, pre-delegation, post-delegation, etc.)"
  - Determine which hooks should be platform-managed vs user-defined
  - Consider how hooks relate to the three-layer governance model
  - Evaluate building a custom Claude Code MCP plugin for CLI enforcement parity
  - Design HOOK-NNN identifiers for app-managed hooks (completing the promotion chain IMPL → RULE → HOOK)

## Motivation

OrqaStudio currently relies on Claude Code hooks (`.claude/settings.json`) for process enforcement — session-start checks, pre-commit reminders. But these only work in the CLI context. The app needs its own hooks layer that:

1. Enforces the same rules when running through the app (not just CLI)
2. Provides backwards compatibility with Claude hooks for CLI users
3. Supports richer hook types (pre-delegation, post-delegation, artifact-change, etc.)
4. Is visible and manageable through the app's governance UI

The hooks section in the UI currently shows "no hooks yet" because it only scans `.orqa/process/hooks/` which contains shell scripts, not a structured hooks config. Claude hooks in `.claude/settings.json` are invisible to the app.

## Inspiration

The Claude hookify plugin provides a pattern for defining hooks declaratively and translating them to Claude Code's hook format. This could be the bridge between app-managed hooks and CLI compatibility.

## Custom Claude Code MCP Plugin (CLI Enforcement Parity)

Instead of using hookify, we could build our own Claude Code MCP plugin that mirrors the app's enforcement mechanisms. This would give true parity between app and CLI:

- The app enforces governance via its built-in process layer (artifact scanning, rule checking, hook triggers)
- The CLI would enforce the same governance via an MCP plugin that reads `.orqa/` and applies the same rules
- Both contexts share one source of truth (`.orqa/`) with one enforcement model
- This could simplify or eliminate the `.claude/` symlink architecture — the MCP plugin replaces what symlinks currently provide (rule/agent/skill loading)

### HOOK-NNN Identifiers

When hooks become app-managed artifacts (not just bash scripts), they should get typed IDs like every other artifact: `HOOK-NNN`. This completes the promotion chain:

```
IMPL-NNN (lesson) → RULE-NNN (rule) → HOOK-NNN (automated enforcement)
```

The lesson documents the pattern, the rule codifies it, and the hook enforces it mechanically. Full traceability from discovery to enforcement.
