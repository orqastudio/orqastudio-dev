**Note:** Two deliverables from this epic were deferred:
- **Visual compliance dashboard** -- not delivered; should be tracked in a future epic when dashboard UI work is prioritised.
- **Session handoff and continuity** -- not delivered; depends on SDK session resume capabilities. Should be tracked in a separate epic.

The enforcement portions (hooks, real-time violation detection) were completed via [EPIC-3a8ad459](EPIC-3a8ad459) and [EPIC-4440cdd4](EPIC-4440cdd4).

## Tasks

- [x] Hooks that inject relevant rules into conversations based on file context — completed via [EPIC-3a8ad459](EPIC-3a8ad459) (companion plugin)
- [x] Real-time violation detection during streaming — completed via enforcement engine in `stream_commands.rs`
- [ ] Visual compliance dashboard — deferred to future epic
- [ ] Session handoff and continuity — deferred to future epic (SDK session resume)

## Context

Superseded by [EPIC-3a8ad459](EPIC-3a8ad459) (Rule Enforcement Engine) and [EPIC-4440cdd4](EPIC-4440cdd4) (Structured Thinking Enforcement) for the enforcement portions. The session handoff/continuity features remain valid future work but should be tracked in a separate epic.

## Implementation Design

Enforcement: completed via [EPIC-3a8ad459](EPIC-3a8ad459) and [EPIC-4440cdd4](EPIC-4440cdd4).
Continuity: requires separate epic for SDK session resume and cross-session search.
