## What

[RULE-7b770593](RULE-7b770593) defines the documentation gate as NON-NEGOTIABLE — all `docs-required` items must exist before an epic moves from `draft` to `ready`. Currently orchestrator-enforced via manual checking. Automate it.

## How

1. Create a validation script that reads an epic's `docs-required` frontmatter array
2. For each entry: if it matches an artifact ID pattern (e.g., `[AD-e513c9e4](AD-e513c9e4)`), check if that artifact exists in the graph. If it is a file path, check if the file exists on disk.
3. If any required doc is missing, report which ones and exit non-zero
4. Can be a standalone script or integrated into the pre-commit hook when epic status changes

## Verification

- [ ] Epic with missing docs-required items produces clear error listing what's missing
- [ ] Epic with all docs-required items present passes validation
- [ ] Epic with empty docs-required passes validation
- [ ] Both artifact ID refs and file path refs are handled
