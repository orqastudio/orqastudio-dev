## What

Audit and clean documentation/ so it only contains human-readable guides, not process definitions.

## How

1. List all files in `.orqa/documentation/`
2. For each: is this a human guide or a process definition?
3. Process definitions → absorb into rules or skills
4. Human guides → keep, ensure they reference process artifacts rather than defining them
5. Update `project.json` if subdirectory structure changes

## Verification

- Every file in documentation/ is a human-consumption guide
- No process definitions remain in documentation/
- All absorbed content is traceable to its new location
