title: Resolve AD-2aa4d6db SQLite scoping violation
description: "Governance scan results should produce research artifacts (.orqa/ files), not SQLite rows. Migrate governance tables out of SQLite."

  - AD-2aa4d6db updated to reflect the decision
  - artifacts table clarified as read-through cache of file-based artifacts

## What

Audit found `governance_analyses`, `governance_recommendations`, and `artifacts` tables in SQLite. [AD-2aa4d6db](AD-2aa4d6db) says governance data should be file-based with the node graph as query layer.

## How

1. Remove `governance_analyses` and `governance_recommendations` tables from SQLite
2. Governance scan results should produce research artifacts in `.orqa/delivery/research/` that can be promoted to epics/tasks
3. Update [AD-2aa4d6db](AD-2aa4d6db) to reflect this decision
4. Clarify `artifacts` table as a read-through cache (not source of truth) of file-based artifacts

## Verification

[AD-2aa4d6db](AD-2aa4d6db) accurately describes the actual persistence strategy. No undocumented SQLite tables.
