## What

Verify the full graph-based injection pipeline works end-to-end: a task with `docs` and `skills` fields causes the plugin to automatically inject the correct context.

## How

1. Create a test task with specific docs and skills fields
2. Start a session referencing that task
3. Verify the plugin reads and injects the docs
4. Verify the plugin loads the skills
5. Trigger a second injection for the same paths — verify dedup works

## Verification

- Docs from task.docs appear in agent context
- Skills from task.skills are loaded
- Epic context from task.epic is available
- No duplicate injections in the same session
