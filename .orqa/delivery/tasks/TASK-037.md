acceptance:
  - Documentation section visible and navigable when clicking the docs icon in ActivityBar
  - Sidebar populates with documentation tree when a direct-type artifact is selected
  - Breadcrumbs start with a home icon linking to dashboard
  - "Breadcrumb path does not duplicate section hierarchy (no \"Planning > Research > .orqa > Planning > Research > Audits\")"
  - Breadcrumb segments between home and leaf are clickable and navigate to the correct level

## Findings Addressed

- **F1**: Documentation not visible in UI at all
- **F2**: Main nav icon → sidebar and artifact viewer are empty
- **F15**: Breadcrumbs duplicate path, base should be home icon

## Investigation Notes

Documentation IS configured in `project.json` (key: "docs", path: ".orqa/documentation"). The scanner should find it. The issue is likely in how `NavigationStore.setActivity("docs")` renders for direct types vs groups — `NavSubPanel` may not trigger correctly for non-group entries.

Breadcrumbs are built in two separate places (`ArtifactNav.svelte:89-118` and `ArtifactViewer.svelte:98-104`) with different logic. The duplication comes from `buildBreadcrumbs()` including both group label AND full path segments.

## Root Cause

Navigation assumes artifact sections are groups with children. Direct types (like "docs") take a different code path that may not populate the sidebar or viewer correctly.
