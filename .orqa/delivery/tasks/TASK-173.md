## What

Replace the flat `tools:` arrays (which mix CLI and App tool names) with `capabilities:`
arrays using the vocabulary from [RULE-92dba0cb](RULE-92dba0cb).

## How

1. For each agent definition, map its current `tools` list to capabilities using the
   mapping table in [RULE-92dba0cb](RULE-92dba0cb)
2. Add `capabilities` field with the abstract names
3. Remove the `tools` field (or leave empty if schema requires it)
4. Verify each agent's capability set is correct for its role

## Verification

- All 7 agent .md files updated
- No concrete tool names remain in `tools` field
- Capabilities match the agent's role boundaries
- Schema validation passes for all agents
