## What

Wire all new enforcement checks into the pre-commit hook so they run automatically on relevant staged files.

## How

Update the pre-commit hook to invoke the new ESLint rules, clippy checks, hook validations, and tooling checks based on which files are staged.

## Verification

Completed as part of [EPIC-4e6e9eae](EPIC-4e6e9eae) Phase 2.

## Lessons

No new lessons.
