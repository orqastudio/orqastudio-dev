title: Structured Rule Enforcement Engine
description: "Replace freeform rule scope strings with a structured enforcement model that maps rules to file paths, artifact types, and agent contexts — enabling the app to automatically load only relevant rules."

horizon: active
research-needed:
  - "Scope model design (path patterns, artifact type filters, agent role filters)"
  - How rules are loaded today (agent reads all rules vs selective loading)
  - Integration with artifact scanner (rule violations as scan findings)
  - "UI for rule management (browse, enable/disable, see enforcement coverage)"
  - Migration path from current freeform scope field to structured model

## Motivation

Rules currently carry a freeform `scope` field (`system`, `domain`, `project`, etc.) that agents interpret loosely. The app doesn't use this field at all — it can't filter rules by relevance to the current file, artifact type, or agent context. Every agent loads every rule, regardless of relevance.

## Concept

Build a structured enforcement model where rules declare **when they apply** using machine-readable patterns:

```yaml
applies-to:
  paths: ["backend/src-tauri/src/**/*.rs"]       # file path globs
  artifacts: ["EPIC-*", "TASK-*"]        # artifact type patterns
  agents: ["implementer", "reviewer"]     # agent roles
  events: ["pre-commit", "task-start"]    # lifecycle events
```

The app then automatically:
1. Loads only relevant rules into agent context based on the current task
2. Runs rule checks as part of the scanning pipeline
3. Reports violations alongside other scan findings
4. Surfaces rule coverage gaps ("these files have no rules governing them")

## Migration

When implemented, the current freeform `scope` field on rules is replaced by the structured `applies-to` block. Existing scope values inform the migration but are not directly reusable.
