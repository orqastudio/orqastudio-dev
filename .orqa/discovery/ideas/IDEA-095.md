title: Documentation as graph-connected knowledge — restructure docs for agent grounding and graph traversal
description: Documentation is currently isolated from the artifact graph. Docs exist as browsable pages but lack relationships to the skills, rules, decisions, and agents that reference them. This means agents can't traverse from a skill to its deeper documentation, grounding documents can't be systematically injected, and documentation quality is uneven because there's no structural standard for what a doc should contain or how it connects to the system.

horizon: active
research-needed:
- Audit all existing documentation for quality, focus, duplication, and graph connectivity
- Define documentation structure standards — what a well-formed doc looks like for agent injection
- Map which skills need accompanying documentation and which docs are orphaned
- Design the relationship pattern between docs, skills, agents, and grounding
relationships:

## Motivation

During a heavy implementation session (31 tasks across 6 epics), the orchestrator lost awareness of the project's core principles. Investigation revealed the root cause is structural: the orchestrator prompt is 100% procedural with no grounding in purpose, and the enforcement system can't inject grounding because documentation is isolated from the artifact graph.

The broader problem: documentation pages have few or no relationships to the skills, rules, and decisions that reference them. Skills mention docs in body text but don't have traversable graph edges. Agents can't follow a path from "I need to understand this concept" through the graph to the documentation that explains it.

This creates three failures:
1. **Agents lose purpose under load** — no grounding mechanism because documentation isn't connected
2. **Knowledge is duplicated** — skills repeat what docs say because there's no "one hop to the source"
3. **Documentation quality is uneven** — no standard for what a doc should contain or how focused it should be

## Sketch

1. Audit all documentation for quality, focus, and graph connectivity
2. Restructure documentation so each page is focused and serves a clear purpose
3. Connect documentation to the graph via relationships (docs ↔ skills, docs ↔ rules, docs ↔ agents)
4. Create grounding documents distilled from restructured docs
5. Wire agents to grounding via `grounded-by` relationships
6. Update the plugin/app to resolve `grounded-by` and inject content at agent initialization
