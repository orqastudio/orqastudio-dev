# TASK-6675ad7c: LSP Server

## Acceptance Criteria

1. LSP server module added to Tauri app (`src/servers/lsp.rs`)
2. tower-lsp and lsp-types dependencies added to Cargo.toml
3. Frontmatter schema validation (required fields, valid types per core.json)
4. Relationship type validation (only keys from core.json + plugins)
5. Relationship target existence (targets must resolve in the graph)
6. Status validation (12 canonical statuses only)
7. Bidirectional relationship enforcement (missing inverse = diagnostic error)
8. Serves over stdio, registered for .md files in .orqa/ directories
