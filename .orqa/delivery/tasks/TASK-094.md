## What

Evaluated the Claude Agent SDK sidecar architecture as the foundation for conversation management, assessing process spawning, the NDJSON streaming protocol, and SDK-specific capabilities and limitations.

## How

Reviewed Agent SDK documentation and prototyped the sidecar process model, validating that a Bun child process spawned by Rust could reliably stream NDJSON responses back to the host.

## Verification

Research findings were captured and informed the sidecar architecture decision recorded in the relevant AD artifact.
