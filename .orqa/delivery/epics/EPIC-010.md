## Why P3

Quality of life improvements for dogfooding. Not blocking but make daily use more pleasant.

## Tasks

- [ ] Project-local database — move SQLite from `app_data_dir` to `.orqa/orqa.db` so session history travels with the project
- [ ] Build splash window — small branded window during `make dev` compilation
- [ ] Custom system prompt templates — pre-built prompts for common scenarios (dogfooding, greenfield, legacy)

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
