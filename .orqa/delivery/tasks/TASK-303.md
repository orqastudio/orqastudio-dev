## What

Audit all Claude memory files in `C:\Users\Bobbi\.claude\projects\C--Users-Bobbi-code-orqa-studio\memory\` and delete those whose content is fully captured in `.orqa/` artifacts.

## How

1. Read each memory file
2. Cross-reference against `.orqa/` artifacts (rules, skills, decisions, documentation)
3. Delete files where the artifact system has full coverage
4. Update MEMORY.md index

## Verification

- `ls` memory directory shows only genuinely additive files
- MEMORY.md is accurate and concise
