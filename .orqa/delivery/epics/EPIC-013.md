## Why P1

Pillar 2 (Learning Through Reflection) — the system must get smarter with each cycle.

## Tasks

- [ ] Post-session hooks that capture lessons automatically to `.orqa/process/lessons/`
- [ ] Rules enforcing lesson checking before implementation
- [ ] Automated promotion suggestions when recurrence >= threshold
- [ ] Lesson dashboard with recurrence trends (LayerChart)
- [ ] Session analytics — pass/fail rates, coverage trends

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
