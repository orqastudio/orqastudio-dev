## What

Catalogued every planned Tauri IPC command with full input/output type signatures, error cases, and the domain module responsible for implementation.

## How

Grouped commands by domain (conversation, artifacts, governance, settings), defined Rust struct shapes for each command's input and output, and mapped each error case to the OrqaError taxonomy.

## Verification

IPC command catalogue is complete with type signatures for every command, all error cases are mapped, and each command is assigned to a domain module.
