## What

Architecture decision formalizing the standards distribution pattern through the knowledge maturity pipeline.

## How

1. Create [AD-8b3962f6](AD-8b3962f6) documenting the pipeline flow
2. Map: Observation (IMPL) → Understanding (IMPL) → Principle (AD) → Practice (SKILL) → Enforcement (RULE) → Verification (VER)
3. Provide concrete examples of standards that have flowed through this pipeline
4. Document how new standards should enter the pipeline

## Verification

- [AD-8b3962f6](AD-8b3962f6) exists and passes schema validation
- Pipeline flow is clearly documented with examples
