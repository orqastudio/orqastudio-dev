title: Create rule for context window management
description: "Formalize the orchestrator's context window management guidelines into a dedicated rule with enforceable constraints."
status: completed

updated: 2026-03-11
acceptance:
  - New rule created covering context window management
  - Guidelines extracted from orchestrator into the rule
  - "Rule has concrete FORBIDDEN patterns (e.g., reading entire files into orchestrator context)"
  - Orchestrator.md references the rule instead of inlining the guidelines

## What

Context window management guidelines currently live as conventions in orchestrator.md Section 1 ("Context Window Management (MANDATORY)"). These are enforceable constraints that should be a rule: delegate don't accumulate, minimize tool output, summarize don't echo, one task at a time, use session state.

## How

1. Read the Context Window Management section in orchestrator.md
2. Determine the next available RULE number
3. Create the rule with: the five constraints as enforceable requirements, FORBIDDEN patterns (reading entire codebases into orchestrator context, echoing full agent output to user, running multiple implementation tasks simultaneously), related rules
4. Update orchestrator.md to reference the rule instead of inlining the guidelines
5. Keep a brief summary in the orchestrator for quick reference, with "See RULE-NNN for full enforcement"

## Verification

- [ ] New rule created with all five context window management constraints
- [ ] FORBIDDEN section with concrete anti-patterns
- [ ] Orchestrator.md references the rule
- [ ] No constraint lost in the extraction
