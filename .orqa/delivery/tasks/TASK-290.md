## What

Create the verification artifact type for tracking verification records.

## How

1. Create `.orqa/delivery/verification/` directory
2. Create `schema.json` with fields: id (VER-NNN), title, description, status, created, updated, verifies, evidence-type, frequency, relationships
3. Create `README.md` with frontmatter for nav tree
4. Add to `project.json` artifacts array

## Verification

- Directory exists with schema.json and README.md
- Schema validates correctly
- App scanner picks up the new artifact type
