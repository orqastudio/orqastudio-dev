title: Project initialization — tooling detection and plugin suggestion
description: "During project setup, detect existing tooling (automated scan + user interview), suggest verification plugins, recommend options if none exist. Mature plugin system could offer to generate plugins automatically."

research-needed:
  - "Extend project-inference skill to detect linters, monitoring tools, CI/CD"
  - User interview flow design for metrics/monitoring tooling
  - Plugin marketplace/registry concept for matching detected tools to plugins
  - AI-assisted plugin generation feasibility — how much can be automated from the plugin template

## Motivation

[AD-a76663db](AD-a76663db) defines three discovery paths during project initialization: automated detection of codebase tooling, user interview about metrics/monitoring tools, and recommendation of options based on project context. This turns OrqaStudio setup into a guided process that connects the project to the verification pipeline from day one.
