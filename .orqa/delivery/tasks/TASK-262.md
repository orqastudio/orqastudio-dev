## What

Add frontend test coverage measurement.

## How

1. Create `vitest.config.ts` with `@vitest/coverage-v8` or `@vitest/coverage-istanbul`
2. Set threshold to 80% (warning mode initially)
3. Add `make coverage-frontend` target
4. Document in commands.md

## Verification

`make coverage-frontend` produces a report with per-file coverage percentages.
