## Context

During UAT of the dashboard and artifact viewer (EPIC-fd22ca6c), Theme D identified 8 findings related to artifact viewer enhancements. These were substantial enough to warrant their own epic rather than being a task within the UAT fixes epic.

## Implementation Design

### Components Created

- **PipelineStepper** — Horizontal lifecycle stepper showing all stages with current stage highlighted
- **ActionsNeeded** — Amber box inferring next actions from artifact status, hidden for terminal states
- **AcceptanceCriteria** — Display-only checklist for task acceptance items

### Components Modified

- **ArtifactViewer** — Integrated PipelineStepper, ActionsNeeded, AcceptanceCriteria
- **FrontmatterHeader** — Horizon as chip field, acceptance skipped from metadata
- **ReferencesPanel** — Grouped relationships by type
- **RelationshipsList** — SvelteMap for lint compliance

## Tasks

- [TASK-e9059b0b](TASK-e9059b0b): Implement all artifact viewer enhancements (done)

## Out of Scope

- Auto-embed child artifacts (milestones→epics, epics→tasks) — requires backend graph queries
- Acceptance criteria state persistence (checked/unchecked tracking in schema) — needs schema design
