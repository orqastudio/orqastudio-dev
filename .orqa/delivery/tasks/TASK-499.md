title: Replace GraphHealthWidget scoring with graph-theoretic metrics
description: "Migrate GraphHealthWidget from file-based scan counts to graph-theoretic metrics sourced from the artifactGraphSDK's graphHealth property. Health score becomes largestComponentRatio; orphan count uses structural 0-degree detection; component count is displayed as disconnected clusters."

acceptance:
  - GraphHealthWidget reads graphHealth from SDK instead of file-based scan counts
  - "Health score uses largestComponentRatio (% of graph in main component)"
  - Orphan count uses graph-theoretic orphans (0 in-degree nodes)
  - "Component count shown as 'N disconnected clusters'"
  - Store graph metrics in health snapshots for trend tracking

## What

Replace the existing file-scan-based scoring in `GraphHealthWidget` with graph-theoretic metrics derived from `artifactGraphSDK.graphHealth`. The health score becomes a structural measure (largest component ratio) rather than a count of file-level issues. Orphan detection switches from filename heuristics to structural 0-degree analysis. Component count is surfaced as human-readable "N disconnected clusters" text.

## How

1. Remove all file-scan count references from `GraphHealthWidget` and its backing store.
2. Subscribe to `artifactGraphSDK.graphHealth` (reactive — no manual refresh needed).
3. Map metrics to display:
   - Health score = `largestComponentRatio * 100` (displayed as a percentage, e.g. "87% connected")
   - Orphan count = `graphHealth.orphanCount` with label "isolated artifacts"
   - Component count = `graphHealth.componentCount` rendered as "N disconnected clusters" (hide if componentCount === 1)
4. Extend the health snapshot type to include `componentCount`, `orphanCount`, `orphanPercentage`, `avgDegree`, `largestComponentRatio` alongside the existing timestamp.
5. Persist snapshots to the existing health snapshot store on each update cycle.
6. Update all TypeScript types — no `any`, no implicit widening.

## Verification

- Widget renders correct values for a known test graph (assert via component test).
- Snapshots written to store contain all five new metric fields.
- `make check` passes with zero warnings and zero type errors.
- Old file-scan count fields are fully removed — `search_regex` for old field names returns no matches.
