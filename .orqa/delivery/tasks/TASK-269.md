relationships:
  - target: EPIC-4726cb3b
    type: delivers
    rationale: Task belongs to this epic
  - target: TASK-91bc09f9

## What

The orchestrator exception list says `.orqa/delivery/` is orchestrator territory, but writing research findings is content creation (Writer role). Tighten the boundary.

## How

1. Update [RULE-532100d9](RULE-532100d9) exception list to clarify:
   - Creating task/epic/idea structure = orchestrator
   - Writing research content, documentation pages = delegate to Writer
2. Keep it concise — add one clarifying sentence, not a new rule

## Verification

[RULE-532100d9](RULE-532100d9) clearly distinguishes structure creation from content authoring.
