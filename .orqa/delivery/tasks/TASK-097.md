## What

Evaluated SQLite access libraries and established the persistence scope boundary: SQLite via rusqlite for conversation data (sessions, messages, metrics) only, with governance data remaining file-based.

## How

Compared rusqlite and sqlx for ergonomics and async compatibility in a Tauri context, then defined the data ownership boundary that became [AD-2aa4d6db](AD-2aa4d6db).

## Verification

The persistence scope decision was recorded and the rusqlite-based persistence layer was implemented in accordance with this design.
