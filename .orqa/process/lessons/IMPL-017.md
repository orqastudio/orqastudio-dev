title: Directory reorganizations leave stale paths in source code
description: "When .orqa/ directories are moved, hardcoded path references in Rust, TypeScript, and test fixtures are not caught by verify-links because it only scans markdown artifacts. Requires a maintained path manifest and source code scanning."

## Pattern

When directory structure changes (e.g., `.orqa/governance/` → `.orqa/process/`, `.orqa/planning/` → `.orqa/delivery/`), the following get updated:

- `project.json` artifacts array (config)
- `verify-links.mjs` artifact discovery paths (tooling)
- Markdown cross-references (artifacts)

But these do NOT get caught:

- Rust scanner paths (`project_scanner.rs` → `scan_governance()`)
- Rust repo test fixtures (`project_settings_repo.rs` test helpers)
- Rust reader test assertions (`artifact_reader.rs` expected labels)
- Any TypeScript code that references `.orqa/` subdirectories directly

The gap exists because `verify-links.mjs` only scans `.orqa/**/*.md` files for artifact cross-references. It does not scan source code for hardcoded `.orqa/` paths.

## Fix

1. Maintain a path manifest (`tools/path-manifest.json`) listing all known `.orqa/` paths used in the system — both in artifacts and in source code
2. Extend `verify-links.mjs` to also scan source files (`.rs`, `.ts`, `.mjs`) for references to `.orqa/` paths and verify them against the manifest
3. When a directory moves, updating the manifest is the single action that makes all stale references visible
