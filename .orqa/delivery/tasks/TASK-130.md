## What

Built the `ToolCallCard` component for rendering tool calls inline within conversation messages, with collapsible input/output display and approval UI.

## How

Implemented the card using shadcn-svelte primitives with a collapsible body showing formatted JSON input and result output. Tool approval state is managed in the conversation store and surfaced via props.

## Verification

Tool call cards render inline in messages, expand to show input and output, and the approval flow correctly gates execution.
