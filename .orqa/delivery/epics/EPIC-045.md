## Context

[AD-774cc3d0](AD-774cc3d0) established that agents should represent universal roles (Orchestrator, Researcher,
Planner, Implementer, Reviewer, Writer, Designer) that work across any project type.
Domain-specific knowledge lives in skills loaded at runtime.

[AD-6f0dea5e](AD-6f0dea5e) established that project setup is skill-driven — no templates directory, no hardcoded
scaffolding. Setup skills contain the knowledge of what a project needs.

Both decisions support OrqaStudio's identity as a clarity engine for structured thinking,
not an AI development tool.

## Implementation Scope

### 1. Agent Restructuring [AD-774cc3d0](AD-774cc3d0)

Replace 16 software-specific agent files with 7 universal role definitions:

**Create:**
- `researcher.md` — Investigation, information gathering, analysis
- `planner.md` — Approach design, architectural evaluation
- `implementer.md` — Building things (code, deliverables, artifacts)
- `reviewer.md` — Quality verification, compliance checking

**Rename:**
- `documentation-writer.md` → `writer.md`

**Update:**
- `orchestrator.md` — Already restructured (Section 1 + 2)
- `designer.md` — Broaden from UI-only to experience/interface/structure design

**Remove (merge into universal roles):**
- backend-engineer.md, frontend-engineer.md, data-engineer.md → Implementer
- devops-engineer.md → Implementer
- systems-architect.md → Planner
- test-engineer.md, code-reviewer.md, qa-tester.md → Reviewer
- ux-reviewer.md, security-engineer.md → Reviewer
- debugger.md, refactor-agent.md → become skills only
- agent-maintainer.md → becomes skill for Orchestrator

### 2. Domain Skill Extraction [AD-774cc3d0](AD-774cc3d0)

Extract domain knowledge from old agents into loadable skills:

| Source Agent | New Skill | Content |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| debugger | `diagnostic-methodology` | Root cause analysis, stack tracing |
| refactor-agent | `restructuring-methodology` | Safe refactoring steps, verification |
| security-engineer | `security-audit` | Audit checklist, threat model |
| agent-maintainer | `governance-maintenance` | Lesson promotion, rule updates |
| code-reviewer | `code-quality-review` | Zero-error policy, check sequence |
| qa-tester | `qa-verification` | E2E test approach, acceptance criteria |
| ux-reviewer | `ux-compliance-review` | UI spec comparison, accessibility |
| test-engineer | `test-engineering` | TDD workflow, coverage, mock boundaries |
| systems-architect | `architectural-evaluation` | Compliance checks, boundary verification |

### 3. Project Setup Skills [AD-6f0dea5e](AD-6f0dea5e)

Create the four setup skills that replace templates:

- `project-setup` — Universal scaffolding (creates .orqa/, installs canon)
- `project-inference` — Reads folder, produces project profile
- `project-migration` — Reads existing agentic config, maps to OrqaStudio
- `project-type-software` — Software development governance preset

### 4. Product Documentation Update

- Update `governance.md` with concept taxonomy from [AD-774cc3d0](AD-774cc3d0)
- Create `governance-hub.md` for the distribution/coexistence model from [AD-6f0dea5e](AD-6f0dea5e)
- Verify `artifact-framework.md` alignment with [AD-774cc3d0](AD-774cc3d0) concepts

## Constraints

- **Orchestrator-only work** — This restructuring affects agent definitions directly.
  Launching agents that reference old/restructured definitions risks confusion.
  All tasks are executed by the orchestrator, not delegated.
- **No code changes** — This epic is entirely governance artifacts (.orqa/ files).
  No changes to backend/src-tauri/, ui/, or sidecars/claude-agentsdk-sidecar/.
- **Backward compatible** — The orchestrator.md (which IS CLAUDE.md via symlink)
  must continue to work after restructuring. Agent references in rules must be
  updated to use new role names.
- **Update all cross-references** — Rules, skills, and other artifacts that reference
  old agent names must be updated in the same commit as the agent changes.
