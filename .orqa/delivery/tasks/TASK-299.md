## What

Audit and align all artifact directory READMEs for consistency and pipeline awareness.

## How

1. List all artifact directories under process/, delivery/, documentation/
2. For each: check README exists, has correct frontmatter, describes pipeline role
3. Create missing READMEs
4. Update existing READMEs for consistency and pipeline language
5. Ensure frontmatter icons, labels, descriptions are appropriate

## Verification

- Every artifact directory has a README
- All READMEs follow consistent format
- Pipeline role is described in each README
