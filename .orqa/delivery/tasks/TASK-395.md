acceptance:
  - "Tauri command stores a health snapshot (node count, edge count, orphans, broken refs, error count, warning count) with timestamp"
  - Tauri command retrieves recent snapshots for trend display
  - SVG sparklines show trends for key metrics on the dashboard
  - Snapshots stored in SQLite metrics table
  - make typecheck passes (no new errors)

## What

Track graph health over time so users can see whether pipeline health is improving or degrading.

## How

1. Add `health_snapshots` SQLite table with graph metrics columns
2. Add `store_health_snapshot` and `get_health_snapshots` Tauri commands
3. After each integrity scan in IntegrityWidget, auto-store a snapshot
4. Create SparklineWidget showing trends for key metrics
5. Add to dashboard below IntegrityWidget

## Verification

- Snapshots persist across app restarts
- Sparklines update after each scan
