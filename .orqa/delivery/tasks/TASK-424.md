## Scope

### Shared vitest config
- Base `vitest.config.ts` with coverage thresholds, reporter settings
- Consistent test file patterns (`**/*.test.ts`)
- Coverage targets (80%+ per module)

### Test utilities
- `createTestGraph(nodes)` — build an ArtifactGraph from minimal node descriptions
- `createTestNode(overrides)` — build an ArtifactNode with sensible defaults
- `mockInvoke(commands)` — mock Tauri invoke for store testing
- Fixture builders for common artifact types (task, epic, idea, rule, etc.)

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow template that repos can reference
- Test + lint + build on every PR
- Coverage report upload
