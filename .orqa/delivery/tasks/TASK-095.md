## What

Audited Tauri v2 against all desktop app requirements, confirming the security model, IPC command system, plugin ecosystem, and cross-platform build support meet project needs.

## How

Reviewed Tauri v2 documentation and migration guides, evaluated the capabilities and permissions model, and validated the invoke-based IPC pattern as the sole frontend-backend interface.

## Verification

Tauri v2 was confirmed as the desktop shell and its patterns were codified in the architecture decisions and coding standards.
