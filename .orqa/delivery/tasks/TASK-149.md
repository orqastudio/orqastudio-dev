## What

[RULE-e9c54567](RULE-e9c54567) (No Stubs) explicitly calls for a stub scanner as part of CI/quality checks. Currently there is no automated enforcement — agents self-police. Create a pre-commit hook that scans staged production files for TODO/FIXME/HACK comments and blocks the commit.

## How

1. Create a hook script that filters staged files to production code (exclude tests/, tmp/)
2. Grep for TODO, FIXME, HACK patterns in those files
3. If matches found, print them and exit non-zero to block the commit
4. Integrate into the existing `.githooks/pre-commit` pipeline or `.orqa/process/hooks/`
5. Update [RULE-e9c54567](RULE-e9c54567) to reference the hook as enforcement mechanism

## Verification

- [ ] Commit with a TODO comment in a .rs file is blocked
- [ ] Commit with a TODO comment in a test file is allowed
- [ ] Hook output clearly shows which files/lines contain stubs
- [ ] Existing pre-commit checks still run
