title: Wire Rust EnforcementEngine to agent tool approval pipeline
description: Connect the existing EnforcementEngine in the Rust backend to the agent execution pipeline so that enforcement entries are evaluated before tool execution in app context.

acceptance:
  - EnforcementEngine.evaluate_file() called before file write operations in agent loop
  - EnforcementEngine.evaluate_bash() called before bash executions in agent loop
  - Block verdicts prevent tool execution and return violation message to agent
  - Warn verdicts allow execution but inject warning into agent context
  - Inject verdicts load skill content and inject into agent context
  - Evaluation adds <10ms latency per tool call

## Scope

### Integration Points

The agent execution pipeline in the app flows through the sidecar → Rust backend. Tool calls arrive as `ToolUse` events. The enforcement engine needs to be called:

1. **Pre-tool-use**: Before executing a tool, evaluate against enforcement entries
2. **Post-tool-use**: After execution, evaluate any post-conditions
3. **Stop**: At session end, evaluate stop entries

### EnforcementEngine API (already exists)

```rust
engine.evaluate_file(&file_path, &content) -> Vec<Verdict>
engine.evaluate_bash(&command) -> Vec<Verdict>
// Stop evaluation needs to be added
```

### Connection to Stream Loop

In `stream_loop.rs`, tool calls are dispatched. Add enforcement evaluation before dispatch:
- Read enforcement rules (cached, reloaded on file change)
- Evaluate against the tool call context
- If block verdict: skip tool execution, return violation as tool result
- If warn/inject verdict: execute tool, inject warning/skill into next turn context
