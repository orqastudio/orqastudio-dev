## What

The artifact browser uses README.md frontmatter (icon, label, description, sort) as the primary metadata source for navigation entries. Stale or inaccurate README descriptions degrade the browsing experience. This task ensures all READMEs reflect the current state after the layer taxonomy rename and structural changes.

## How

1. List all directories under `.orqa/` that contain a README.md
2. For each README, compare its description to the actual contents of the directory
3. Update any descriptions that are stale, inaccurate, or reference deprecated terminology
4. Verify icon choices are appropriate for the group's purpose
5. Ensure sort values produce a logical ordering in the sidebar

## Verification

- [ ] Every `.orqa/**/README.md` has been reviewed
- [ ] No README references "canon" layer (should be "core")
- [ ] Descriptions match actual directory contents
- [ ] App sidebar shows correct labels and descriptions from README metadata
