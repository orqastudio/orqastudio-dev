title: Session state as a browsable artifact in .orqa/
description: "Move session state from tmp/session-state.md into the .orqa/ directory so it becomes a first-class artifact visible in the app's artifact navigation. Enables users to browse session history, see pending decisions, and understand what was happening across sessions — all within the OrqaStudio UI."

research-needed:
  - "What schema should session state artifacts use? (status, active-epic, active-tasks, pending-decisions, scope-status)"
  - "Should session states be ephemeral (overwritten each session) or accumulative (one per session, forming a history)?"
  - "How does this interact with the existing tmp/session-state.md convention? Migration path?"
  - "Should the app show a 'current session' panel or just list session artifacts like any other type?"
  - "What artifact ID prefix? SESSION-NNN? SS-NNN?"
  - "How does this interact with context compaction — should the app auto-write session state when context is about to be compressed?"

## Motivation

Session state currently lives in `tmp/session-state.md` — a gitignored, invisible file that only agents read. This means:

1. **Users can't see it** — the session state file is not browsable in the app
2. **History is lost** — each session overwrites the previous state
3. **No schema enforcement** — the file format is ad-hoc markdown
4. **No relationship tracking** — session state can't link to the epics/tasks it was working on

Moving session state into `.orqa/` makes it a first-class artifact:
- Visible in the app's artifact navigation
- Schema-validated like every other artifact type
- Relationship-tracked (links to active epics, tasks, pending decisions)
- Version-controlled — session history becomes part of the project record

## Sketch

**Directory:** `.orqa/delivery/sessions/` (or `.orqa/sessions/`)

**Schema fields:**
- `id`: SESSION-NNN
- `status`: active | completed | abandoned
- `started`: ISO timestamp
- `ended`: ISO timestamp (null if active)
- `active-epic`: EPIC-NNN reference
- `active-tasks`: array of TASK-NNN references
- `pending-decisions`: array of decision descriptions
- `scope-status`: brief description of scope drift state
- `relationships`: standard relationship array

**Lifecycle:**
- Created at session start (or when agent first writes session state)
- Updated throughout the session as work progresses
- Marked `completed` at session end
- Previous sessions remain as historical records

This gives Purpose Through Continuity (PILLAR-94b281db) a permanent, browsable record — not just a transient file.
