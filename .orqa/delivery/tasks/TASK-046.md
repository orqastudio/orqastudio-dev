## Findings Addressed

- **F20**: Epic titles contain process words instead of describing outcomes

## Examples to Fix

- "UAT Round 1 — Dogfood Readiness Verification" → "Dogfood Readiness Verification"
- Review all EPIC-*.md files for similar patterns

## Enforcement

Add to artifact-lifecycle.md under Epic creation standards:
> Epic titles describe what is achieved, not how work is organised. Avoid process words (UAT, Phase, Sprint, Round) unless they describe the actual deliverable.

## What

See task description and acceptance criteria in frontmatter.

## How
