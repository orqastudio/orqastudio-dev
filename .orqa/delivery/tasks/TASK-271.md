  - Plugin reads rule-overrides from active task frontmatter
  - Falls back to epic rule-overrides if task has none
  - Suspended rules are included in context but annotated as suspended with reason
  - Non-suspended rules load normally

## What

Extend the CLI plugin's rule loading to check the active task/epic for `rule-overrides`. Suspended rules are still injected into agent context but wrapped with an annotation explaining the suspension and its reason.

## How

1. Read the active task's frontmatter for `rule-overrides`
2. If absent, read the parent epic's `rule-overrides`
3. When injecting rules, check each against the override list
4. Suspended rules get prefixed: "NOTE: This rule is suspended for this task because: [reason]. It remains visible for awareness but is not enforced."

## Verification

- Create a test task with `rule-overrides` suspending [RULE-a764b2ae](RULE-a764b2ae)
- Verify that [RULE-a764b2ae](RULE-a764b2ae) appears in agent context with suspension annotation
- Verify other rules load normally
