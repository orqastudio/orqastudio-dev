title: Security Audit — Prompt Injection and Encoded Asset Protection
description: "Comprehensive security audit covering prompt injection attack vectors, encoded asset vulnerabilities, and defense mechanisms. Protect against malicious content in governance artifacts, tool outputs, and user inputs that could manipulate AI agent behavior."
status: captured

updated: 2026-03-13
horizon: someday
research-needed:
  - "What prompt injection vectors exist in a desktop AI app with file system access?"
  - "How can governance artifacts (.orqa/ markdown files) be weaponized via injection?"
  - "What encoded asset attacks apply (base64, unicode homoglyphs, invisible characters)?"
  - "How do tool outputs (file reads, search results) become injection vectors?"
  - "What defense mechanisms are effective (input sanitization, output validation, sandboxing)?"
  - "How do other AI-assisted tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code) handle prompt injection?"

## Motivation

OrqaStudio reads governance artifacts, user-authored markdown, and tool outputs directly into AI agent context. This creates multiple prompt injection surfaces:

1. **Governance artifacts** — malicious content in .orqa/ files could manipulate agent behavior
2. **Tool outputs** — file read results, search results, and external data could contain injection payloads
3. **Encoded assets** — base64-encoded content, unicode tricks, or invisible characters could bypass input validation
4. **Cross-session persistence** — injected content in SQLite (session history) could affect future sessions
5. **Plugin attack surface** — future plugin system (AD-69072318) opens additional vectors

A structured security audit would identify vulnerabilities, implement defenses, and establish security testing patterns.

## Sketch

- Threat model mapping all injection surfaces (input, output, storage, config)
- Input sanitization layer for content entering agent context
- Output validation for tool results before display
- Encoded content detection (base64 payloads, unicode anomalies)
- Content Security Policy equivalent for governance artifacts
- Security test suite with known injection patterns
