title: Pipeline stage visualization widget
description: "Add a PipelineWidget to the dashboard showing Knowledge Maturity Pipeline stages (Observation → Understanding → Principle → Practice → Enforcement → Verification) with artifact counts, flow connections, and bottleneck highlighting."
status: completed
created: 2026-03-13
updated: 2026-03-13
acceptance:
  - PipelineWidget shows 6 pipeline stages as a horizontal flow
  - Each stage shows artifact count derived from artifact type mapping
  - Flow connections between stages indicate relationship edges
  - Bottleneck stages (artifacts without downstream connections) highlighted in amber/red
  - Clicking a stage could be wired to navigation (stretch)
  - Widget appears on ProjectDashboard
  - make typecheck passes (no new errors)

## What

Visualize the Knowledge Maturity Pipeline on the dashboard so users can see at a glance how knowledge flows from observation through enforcement.

## How

1. Map artifact types to pipeline stages (lesson→Observation/Understanding, decision→Principle, skill→Practice, rule→Enforcement)
2. Use SDK traversal methods to count relationship connections between stages
3. Build a CSS/SVG flow visualization with stage boxes and connecting elements
4. Detect bottlenecks: stages with high artifact counts but few downstream connections

## Verification

- Widget renders on dashboard with real artifact data
- Bottleneck highlighting works for stages with unconnected artifacts
