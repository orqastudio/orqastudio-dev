## What

Search errors use .map_err(|e| e.to_string()) which loses type info. Add proper From impl and propagate typed errors.

## How

To be determined during implementation.

## Verification

- [ ] OrqaError has a DuckDb variant with From<duckdb::Error>
- [ ] All .map_err(|e| e.to_string()) in search/ are replaced with ? operator
- [ ] Error messages in frontend still show meaningful text
- [ ] make check passes
