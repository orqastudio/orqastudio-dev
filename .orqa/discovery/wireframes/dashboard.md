<!-- FRESHNESS NOTE (2026-03-15): This wireframe is significantly outdated. The Scanner Dashboard, Metrics Dashboard, and Learning Loop views shown here were the original design vision but were never built as described. The implemented dashboard (EPIC-11561c51) uses a narrative flow layout with pillar-aligned columns: MilestoneContextCard, IntegrityWidget, PipelineWidget, GraphHealthWidget, LessonVelocityWidget, DecisionQueueWidget, and ImprovementTrendsWidget. The scanner dashboard and metrics KPI cards do not exist as standalone Explorer Panel views — their data surfaces as widgets on the unified dashboard. The learning loop view corresponds to the artifact browser's Lessons category, not a separate dashboard. This wireframe should be rewritten to reflect the current dashboard architecture if it is to remain authoritative. -->



**Date:** 2026-03-02 | **Informed by:** Information Architecture, [Frontend Research](RES-df5560cb)

Dashboard views appear in the Explorer Panel and provide operational visibility into scanning, metrics, and the learning loop. These are post-MVP features designed early to validate the information architecture and panel system.

> **Note:** These wireframes represent future features (Scanner Dashboard, Metrics Dashboard, Learning Loop). They are designed now to ensure the panel system and data model accommodate these views without rework.

### How to Navigate to Dashboards

Dashboard views are Explorer Panel views, accessed the same way as the artifact browser or settings:

| Entry Point | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **Activity Bar icons** | Scanners, Metrics, and Learning icons in the Activity Bar switch the Explorer Panel to the corresponding dashboard view. |
| **Project Dashboard** | Scanner status, metrics, and learning summaries on the Project Dashboard are clickable links that activate the corresponding Activity Bar icon. |
| **Activity Bar** | Click the Scanners, Metrics, or Learning icons in the Activity Bar. |

All dashboards share the Explorer Panel — switching to a dashboard replaces the current Explorer view. The conversation always remains visible in the Chat Panel.

## 1. Scanner Dashboard (Mixed Pass/Fail Results)

The scanner dashboard shows all configured scanners with their current status, accessible via the Scanners icon in the Activity Bar.

```plantuml
@startsalt

  { <b>Scanners</b> (via Activity Bar) }

  { <b>Scanner Dashboard</b> | . | . | [Run All Scanners] }

  { Filter: | (X) All | () Passing | () Failing }

## 2. Scanner Dashboard -- Violation Detail Expanded

When a failing scanner row is clicked, it expands to show individual violations with file locations and descriptions.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  { <b>Scanners</b> (via Activity Bar) }
  ---
  { <b>Scanner Dashboard</b> | . | . | [Run All Scanners] }
  ---
  { Filter: | (X) All | () Passing | () Failing }

  {SI
    {
      <color:green><&circle-check></color> <b>lint-rules</b>
      ESLint governance rules | Last run: 2 min ago
      Result: <b>PASS</b> | 0 violations
    }
    ---
    {+
      <color:red><&circle-x></color> <b>architecture-boundaries</b>

        2 | src/hooks/db-query.ts | Hook accesses database without repository abstraction | Error
        3 | ui/src/lib/utils/sidecar.ts | Utility module depends on Tauri API; use adapter pattern | Warning
      }
      ---
      { [Fix in Session] | [Dismiss] | . | 3 violations across 3 files }
    }

      ---
      {#
        # | File | Violation | Severity

      }
      ---
      { [Fix in Session] | [Dismiss] | . | 2 violations across 2 files }
    }
    ---
    {
      <color:green><&circle-check></color> <b>naming-conventions</b>

@endsalt
```

### Violation Detail Elements

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Violation table** | Sortable columns. Click file path to open in editor. |
| **Severity** | Critical, Error, Warning. Color-coded. |
| **Fix in Session** | Creates a new session pre-filled with scanner violations as context for AI-assisted fixing. |
| **Dismiss** | Collapses the violation detail back to the summary row. |
| **Run Scanner** | Re-runs just this individual scanner. |

## 3. Metrics Dashboard with KPI Cards and Chart

The metrics dashboard provides operational KPIs with trend indicators and sparklines, plus a detailed time-series chart area.

```plantuml
@startsalt

  { <b>Metrics</b> (via Activity Bar) }
  ---
  { <b>Metrics Dashboard</b> | . | . | Period: ^Last 7 days^ }

  {+
    <b>Lesson Log</b> (recent entries)

    {#
      Type | Title | Date | Status
      IMPL | Add retry logic to sidecar calls | Mar 2 | Promoted

## 4. Learning Loop -- IMPL/RETRO Cards

The learning loop view manages implementation lessons and retrospective insights, with a promotion workflow for converting them into governance artifacts.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  { <b>Learning</b> (via Activity Bar) }
  ---
  { <b>Learning Loop</b> | . | . | [+ New Entry] }
  ---
  { Filter: | (X) All | () IMPL | () RETRO | . | Status: ^All Statuses^ }
  ---
  {SI
    {+
      { <b>[IMPL]</b> | <b>Add retry logic to sidecar calls</b> | . | [Promoted] }
      ---
      Sidecar connections drop intermittently. Added
      exponential backoff with 3 retries. This pattern
      should be standard for all sidecar communication.
      ---
      { Date: Mar 2, 2026 | Source: <&link-intact> Session #42 }
      ---
      { Promoted to: <&document> Rule: sidecar-retry-pattern }
    }
    ---
    {+
      { <b>[RETRO]</b> | <b>Session context window overflow</b> | . | [Draft] }
      ---
      Long sessions with many tool calls exceed the
      context window. Need to implement summarization
      or sliding window for sessions > 50 messages.
      ---
      { Date: Mar 1, 2026 | Source: <&link-intact> Session #38 }
      ---
      { [Promote to Rule] | [Promote to Lesson] | [Archive] }
    }
    ---
    {+
      { <b>[IMPL]</b> | <b>Use adapter pattern for Tauri APIs</b> | . | [Promoted] }
      ---
      Direct Tauri API calls in components make testing
      impossible. Adapter pattern wraps all Tauri invoke
      calls so they can be mocked in tests.
      ---
      { Date: Feb 28, 2026 | Source: <&link-intact> Session #35 }
      ---
      { Promoted to: <&document> Rule: tauri-adapter-pattern }
    }
    ---
    {+
      { <b>[RETRO]</b> | <b>Scanner false positives on test files</b> | . | [Review] }
      ---
      Architecture boundary scanner flags test helper
      files that intentionally cross module boundaries.
      Need scanner exclude patterns for test directories.
      ---
      { Date: Feb 27, 2026 | Source: <&link-intact> Session #31 }
      ---
      { Workflow: Draft -> <b>Review</b> -> Promoted }
      ---
      { [Approve & Promote] | [Return to Draft] | [Archive] }
    }
    ---
    {+
      { <b>[RETRO]</b> | <b>Model selection affects code quality</b> | . | [Archived] }
      ---
      Smaller models produce more verbose, less idiomatic
      Rust code. Default to opus for Rust backend tasks.
      ---
      { Date: Feb 25, 2026 | Source: <&link-intact> Session #28 }
      ---
      { <i>Archived on Mar 1 -- superseded by model routing rule</i> }
    }
