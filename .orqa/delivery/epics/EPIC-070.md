## Context

UAT round 2 identified the need for dynamic graph-driven tables in markdown rendering (e.g. tasks table on epics showing live status), body template validation with required headings, and potential new artifact types (personas).

## Implementation Design

### Phase 1: Body template validation
- Define required headings per artifact type in schema bodyTemplate
- Validate non-empty content under required headings
- Add to integrity validator

### Phase 2: Dynamic artifact tables
- New markdown extension: `:::tasks` or similar syntax triggers a graph query
- Renders as a live table with status, title, priority from graph nodes
- Supported contexts: tasks-on-epic, epics-on-milestone, children-of-any-type

### Phase 3: Schema evolution
- Personas as potential new artifact type (needs research)
- Any additional relationship types identified during EPIC-58ba6d53

## Tasks

- [TASK-ec8c8405](TASK-ec8c8405): Body template validation — required headings with non-empty content in integrity validator
- [TASK-c4de13e1](TASK-c4de13e1): Dynamic artifact table component — graph-queried, injectable into markdown
- [TASK-53eb8161](TASK-53eb8161): Research personas as a top-level artifact type
- [TASK-3eceac9b](TASK-3eceac9b): Acceptance criteria audit — thorough backfill across all tasks

## Out of Scope

- Full markdown editor (future)
- Artifact creation/editing through the UI (future)
