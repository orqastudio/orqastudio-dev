## What

158 Svelte components have zero tests. Set up the infrastructure and write template tests for the most critical shared components.

## How

1. Install `@testing-library/svelte` and `jsdom`
2. Configure Vitest environment for component testing
3. Write tests for: EmptyState, LoadingSpinner, ErrorDisplay, StatusIndicator, SearchInput
4. Document component testing patterns

## Verification

`make test-frontend` runs component tests. Test files exist in component directories.
