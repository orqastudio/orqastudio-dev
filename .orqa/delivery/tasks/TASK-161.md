## What

The scrollbar styling varies across panels — the viewer panel has the correct appearance but other panels (conversation, artifact list, settings, etc.) use different or default scrollbar styles. This is a visual inconsistency bugfix.

## How

1. Inspect the viewer panel's scrollbar CSS (likely in a component CSS or global styles)
2. Extract the scrollbar styles into a shared CSS class or Tailwind utility
3. Apply to all scrollable panels: conversation panel, artifact list, settings, any other scrollable containers
4. Remove any panel-specific scrollbar overrides that conflict

## Verification

- [ ] All panels have visually identical scrollbars
- [ ] Viewer panel scrollbar unchanged (it's the reference)
- [ ] Scrollbar works correctly on all panel content (smooth scrolling, correct thumb size)
