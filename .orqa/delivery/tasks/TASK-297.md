## What

Full inventory of documentation/ to understand current state and identify gaps.

## How

1. List all files in documentation/ recursively
2. For each: is it current? stale? placeholder? human-consumption or process-definition?
3. Remove stale content
4. Flag gaps — what documentation SHOULD exist but doesn't
5. Ensure remaining docs reference process artifacts rather than defining them

## Verification

- Documentation inventory report
- No stale or placeholder content remains
- Gap list for future documentation work
