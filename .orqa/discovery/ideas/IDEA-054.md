title: Web Search Skill for Agent Research
description: "A skill that teaches agents how to effectively use web search and web fetch tools for external research — query formulation, source evaluation, result synthesis, and citation practices."
status: captured

horizon: later
research-needed:
  - "What web search/fetch tools are available in each context? (CLI MCP tools, app-embedded tools)"
  - "What query patterns produce the best results for technical research?"
  - "How should agents evaluate source credibility and recency?"
  - "How should web research findings be captured in .orqa/ artifacts?"
  - "Should web search results be cached/indexed for future sessions?"

## Motivation

Agents currently have access to web search and web fetch tools but no structured methodology for using them effectively. Good web research requires:

1. **Query formulation** — knowing how to phrase searches for technical topics, library docs, API references
2. **Source evaluation** — prioritising official docs over blog posts, checking recency, cross-referencing
3. **Result synthesis** — extracting the relevant information and discarding noise
4. **Citation** — recording where information came from so findings are traceable

A web research skill would be the counterpart to `code-search` (which teaches codebase search). Together they cover the two main research surfaces: internal code and external knowledge.

## Sketch

- Skill covers: query strategies (exact phrases, site-scoped, date-filtered), source hierarchy (official docs > GitHub issues > blog posts > forums), synthesis patterns (extract key facts, note version constraints), citation format for research documents
- Complements the `code-search` skill (internal) with external research capability
- Could link to [IDEA-59ce25c3](IDEA-59ce25c3) (tool-linked skills) — the web search tool gets this skill as its documentation
