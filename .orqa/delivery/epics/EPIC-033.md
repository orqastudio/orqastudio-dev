title: "Vision Alignment & Schema Simplification"
description: "Align all documentation, governance rules, agent definitions, and code with the evolved vision: .orqa/ as sole source of truth, provider-agnostic AI integration, three-layer architecture (Canon/Project/Plugin), and simplified artifact schema where plans are merged into research and tasks trace cleanly to epics to milestones."

## Implementation Design

### Phase A: Schema Simplification (DONE)
- Removed Plan type from artifact-framework.md
- Migrated 9 plan files to research, marked surpassed
- Updated artifact-lifecycle.md rules
- Added Research schema with `draft → complete → surpassed` workflow

### Phase B: Reference Migration (IN PROGRESS)
- Convert `plan:` field to `research-refs:` on all epics
- Update all tasks to reference `epic: [EPIC-4bbc3439](EPIC-4bbc3439)`
- Remove `plans` from project.json artifacts config
- Update Rust types and frontend types to remove `plan` field
- Verify every task has a valid epic, every epic has a valid milestone

### Phase C: Enforcement
- Create/update rules and skills to enforce the new structure
- Ensure no `plan:` field can be created going forward
- Verify scanning/reading code handles `research-refs:` correctly

### Phase D: Historical Backfill [TASK-24c90717](TASK-24c90717)
- Decision chains, surpassed artifacts, lesson history
- Reference integrity for all existing artifacts

## Acceptance Criteria

- No `plan:` field in any artifact frontmatter (replaced by `research-refs:` on epics, `epic:` on tasks)
- No Plan type in artifact-framework.md or artifact-lifecycle.md
- Every task has an `epic:` field referencing an existing epic
- Every epic has a `milestone:` field referencing an existing milestone
- Rust types and frontend types have no `plan` field
- `research-refs:` field documented and in use
- All audit results recorded as research documents

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.
