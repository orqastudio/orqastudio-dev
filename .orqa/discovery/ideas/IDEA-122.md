title: "Remove embedded software plugin from app — load all plugins from disk"
description: "The app currently has a TypeScript copy of the software plugin manifest compiled into the frontend. This is wrong — first-party plugins should be installed during project setup, not bundled in the binary. All plugins load the same way: from orqa-plugin.json on disk."

research-needed:
  - How does the frontend currently register plugins? Can it load orqa-plugin.json via IPC instead of static import?
  - What's the Rust-side plugin discovery path? Does it already scan plugins/ at runtime?
  - How does project setup install first-party plugins? From the registry? From a bundled set? From GitHub?
  - Should first-party plugins be pre-downloaded during orqa install (for dev) but not compiled into the app?
  - What happens if a project has no plugins? The app should still work — just no delivery artifacts
relationships:
  - target: PILLAR-001

    rationale: Loading plugins uniformly from disk makes the plugin architecture visible and consistent — no hidden compiled-in exceptions

# Remove Embedded Software Plugin

## The Problem

`app/ui/src/lib/plugins/software-project/manifest.ts` is a hand-maintained TypeScript copy of `plugins/software/orqa-plugin.json`. It's already out of sync (missing 8 skills and the merged-into extension). This pattern:

- Creates a maintenance burden (two files to keep in sync)
- Treats the software plugin as special (bundled) when it should be equal to any other plugin
- Assumes every project needs the software plugin (not true — research projects, consulting projects, etc.)

## The Fix — DONE

1. ~~Delete the TypeScript manifest copy~~ — done, manifests load via IPC
2. ~~Remove hardcoded plugin registration from +layout.svelte~~ — done, generic loader
3. ~~Remove compiled component registry~~ — done, plugins ship pre-bundled views
4. App discovers installed plugins at runtime, registers from canonical orqa-plugin.json

## Remaining Work

- Move RoadmapView from the app into the software plugin's own bundle
- Create the plugin-view route that mounts plugin bundles at runtime
- Define the plugin view protocol (how a plugin exports a Svelte component bundle)
- Plugins use @orqastudio/sdk for data and @orqastudio/svelte-components for UI — feels seamless

## Project Setup Flow

When a user creates a new project:

1. AI asks about the project type and goals
2. Based on the conversation, AI recommends plugins (software, research, consulting, custom)
3. Plugins are installed from the official registry (or created on the fly for custom use cases)
4. `project.json` is configured with the installed plugins' navigation, delivery hierarchy, and relationships
5. The setup skills (SKILL-021 through SKILL-024) guide this process

The app binary is domain-agnostic. Domain knowledge comes entirely from plugins.
