## What

Implemented full CRUD IPC commands for sessions and messages, wired through the repository pattern to SQLite.

## How

Created `#[tauri::command]` handlers for each operation, delegating to domain services and repository implementations. All commands are registered in the Tauri app builder and return `Result<T, OrqaError>`.

## Verification

All session and message operations execute end-to-end from the frontend, error cases return typed `OrqaError` variants, and data persists correctly across app restarts.
