## What

Built the session management UI including a dropdown selector with search, session creation, deletion, and navigation between conversations.

## How

Implemented a session selector component backed by the session store, with search filtering and create/delete actions wired to IPC commands. Session navigation updates the active session in the store and loads the corresponding message history.

## Verification

Users can browse, search, and switch sessions, create new ones, and session state is correctly restored after app restart.
