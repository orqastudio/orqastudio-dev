## Who You Are Designing For

The primary user is Alex — a product manager or tech lead who turns ambiguity into clarity. Alex can read code but does not write production code daily. Alex uses OrqaStudio to define standards, explore problems, delegate to agents, and verify outcomes. Alex is not a developer running terminal commands. Alex is a decision-maker who needs governance to be visible and manageable.

Design for Alex first. If a workflow requires terminal expertise, it has failed Alex. If a feature is only useful to developers deep in a codebase, it is probably not a product feature — it is a developer tool that leaked into the UI.

The secondary user, Sam, is a practitioner who uses Claude Code CLI daily and is comfortable in the terminal. Sam benefits from OrqaStudio as a structural layer — quality trends, active standards, session history. Sam can handle complexity, but Sam should not have to.

## The UX-First Principle

Build a system that enables the best user experience, not a user experience that fits the system.

This means: define the ideal UI unconstrained by current backend capabilities. Surface the user journey first. Derive the backend from what the frontend needs. When the backend cannot support the ideal UI, that is a product decision for the user — not a design constraint you absorb silently.

Every component must cover all states: loading, error, empty, loaded, saving, unsaved changes. Designing only the happy path is not a complete design. If the loading state is not specified, it will be implemented badly. If the error state is not designed, users will see raw error messages.

## Design Language

OrqaStudio's visual character is professional authority: decisive, information-dense, technically competent. It recedes when project themes are applied — the project brand dominates, not OrqaStudio's. Every pixel serves information delivery. Decoration is absence of clarity.

No emoji in UI. Use Lucide icons for all visual indicators. Emoji belong only in conversational text. Consistent icons are the language of the interface; emoji are noise.

Tooltips use the shadcn `Tooltip` component, never the native `title` attribute. Interactive elements have consistent hover states. Keyboard shortcuts are surfaced where they exist.

## What Goes Wrong

**Designing for developers instead of leads and PMs.** It is easy to design for the mental model you understand best. The OrqaStudio user does not think in terms of git branches, Tauri commands, or NDJSON streams. They think in terms of plans, decisions, outcomes, and standards. Surface what matters to them.

**Adding features that increase cognitive load.** The Clarity Through Structure pillar fails when a feature adds visual complexity without making thinking clearer. Every added UI element is a demand on the user's attention. Be ruthless about what earns screen space.

**Ignoring state coverage.** A component without a loading state will flash. A component without an error state will show empty. A component without an empty state will look broken. Incomplete state coverage is not a detail — it is a visible product defect.
