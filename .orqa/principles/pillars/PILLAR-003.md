## What This Pillar Means

Purpose Through Continuity is the principle that the system actively maintains coherence between what the user intended and what is actually happening — across time, across interruptions, and across the complexity that accumulates during extended work.

Where Pillar 1 covers the present (make the current state clear) and Pillar 2 covers past-to-future (learn from experience), Pillar 3 covers through time: maintaining the thread of purpose from when work began to when it completes.

This pillar governs features that:

- **Mid-cycle orientation** — Periodic re-grounding in the original goal during extended work, so users never lose sight of why they started
- **Decision persistence** — Pending decisions survive interruptions and context changes, preventing silent knowledge loss between sessions or across long workflows
- **Scope coherence** — Changes to scope are explicit, tracked, and user-approved rather than drifting implicitly as implementation details accumulate
- **Therapeutic framing** — The system acts as a thinking partner that reduces cognitive burden, not one that adds to it through process overhead or information overload
- **Implementation awareness** — The system knows when execution has drifted from intention and surfaces that drift before it compounds

## Examples of Work That Serves This Pillar

- Session state that captures in-progress decisions, blockers, and resumption context so nothing is lost between sessions
- Scope tracking that surfaces when deliverables have been silently added, removed, or deferred without user approval
- Mid-task orientation prompts that reconnect implementation work to the original epic purpose
- Decision queues that persist unanswered questions across interruptions rather than dropping them
- Cognitive load indicators that help users recognise when a session has accumulated too much complexity
- Progress summaries that show not just what was done, but how it connects to the stated goal

## Anti-Patterns

- Features that add process steps without reducing the user's cognitive burden
- Systems that lose pending decisions or unanswered questions when context changes
- Scope changes that happen implicitly through implementation choices without surfacing them to the user
- Workflows that require the user to hold the thread of purpose in their own memory across sessions
- Tools that generate more information than the user can absorb, adding noise rather than clarity

## Conflict Resolution

Pillars are equal in importance. When this pillar appears to conflict with Pillar 1 (Clarity Through Structure) or Pillar 2 (Learning Through Reflection), the conflict should be flagged to the user for resolution rather than one pillar automatically winning. Agents do not prioritise one pillar over another unilaterally.

In practice, this pillar often reinforces both others: maintaining purpose requires the structured artifacts that Pillar 1 provides, and benefits from the accumulated lessons that Pillar 2 captures. Tension is most likely when continuity-preserving features risk adding cognitive overhead (conflicting with this pillar's own therapeutic framing principle) or when extensive reflection slows momentum toward the user's goal.
