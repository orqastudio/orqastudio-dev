title: Create rule for tool access restrictions per role
description: Formalize the tool access restrictions defined in agent YAML tools lists into a dedicated rule that enforces which tools each universal role may use.

  - Ownership boundaries from RULE-532100d9 reinforced through tool restrictions

## What

Tool access restrictions per role are currently defined only in each agent's YAML `tools:` list. There is no rule that enforces these restrictions or makes them visible as a constraint. This means an agent could use tools outside its role's scope without any governance artifact flagging it.

## How

1. Read each agent YAML file in `.orqa/process/agents/` and extract the `tools:` lists
2. Determine the next available RULE number
3. Create the rule with: a table mapping each role to its permitted tools, the rationale for each restriction (e.g., Reviewer cannot Edit because it doesn't implement fixes), FORBIDDEN patterns, related rules (RULE-532100d9 ownership boundaries)
4. Agent YAML remains the detailed source — the rule provides the enforceable constraint and overview

## Verification

- [ ] New rule created with role-to-tool mapping table
- [ ] Every universal role's tool restrictions documented
- [ ] FORBIDDEN section with concrete violations
- [ ] Consistent with agent YAML tools lists
- [ ] References [RULE-532100d9](RULE-532100d9) (agent delegation) for ownership boundary context
