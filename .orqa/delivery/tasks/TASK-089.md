## What

Create a skill that captures the full artifact audit methodology so future audits are systematic, repeatable, and don't require rediscovering the process.

## How

1. Review the audit process from [EPIC-0a8a5e72](EPIC-0a8a5e72) (planning artifacts) and [EPIC-4a7aeacb](EPIC-4a7aeacb) (team/enforcement)
2. Extract the common patterns: status verification, cross-reference checks, path consistency, codebase alignment
3. Organize into per-artifact-type checklists
4. Write as a SKILL.md with clear sections for each audit dimension
5. Add to relevant agent `skills:` lists

## Verification

- Skill file exists and follows SKILL.md format
- A reviewer agent loading this skill can execute a full audit without additional context
- All artifact types are covered
