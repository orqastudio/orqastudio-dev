## What

The SessionStart hook replaces both the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` symlink (orchestrator
loading) and the `session-start-hook.sh` shell script. It reads the orchestrator
definition and injects it as system context, then runs session health checks.

## How

1. Create `hooks/session-start.md` hook definition
2. On SessionStart, read `.orqa/process/agents/orchestrator.md`
3. Return orchestrator content as `additionalContext`
4. Run session checks: `git stash list`, `git worktree list`, `git status`
5. Include check results in additionalContext

## Verification

- New session loads orchestrator context without `.claude/CLAUDE.md` symlink
- Session-start checks run and report stashes/worktrees/uncommitted files
- Removing `.claude/CLAUDE.md` symlink doesn't break orchestrator loading
