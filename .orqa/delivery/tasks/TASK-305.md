## What

Resolve all 9 broken-link errors reported by `verify-links`:

- SKILL-bcfeb64e — 4 references in various artifacts
- AGENT-1dab5ebe — 1 reference
- AGENT-caff7bc1 — 1 reference
- AGENT-fb0ce261 — 1 reference
- VER-NNN — 2 references

## How

1. For each broken reference, determine: does the referenced artifact need to exist (create it) or was the reference premature (remove it)?
2. Create artifacts or remove references accordingly
3. Run `node tools/verify-links.mjs --check-paths` to confirm zero errors

## Verification

- `node tools/verify-links.mjs --check-paths` exits 0 or reports only warnings (no errors)
