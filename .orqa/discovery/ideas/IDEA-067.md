title: AI-assisted plugin generation
description: "When the plugin system is mature, OrqaStudio should be able to generate tooling plugins automatically. The structure (skill + hooks + data collection) is well-defined enough that AI can scaffold a working plugin from a tool description."

horizon: someday
research-needed:
  - "Plugin template structure — what's fixed vs what varies per tool"
  - How much tool-specific knowledge does the AI need to generate a working plugin
  - Quality gates — how to verify a generated plugin actually works
  - Depends on plugin architecture maturity (IDEA-c773575b)

## Motivation

[AD-a76663db](AD-a76663db) notes that the structure and requirements for a tooling plugin (skill + hooks + data collection) are well-defined. During project initialization, if no existing plugin matches detected tooling, the system could offer to generate one. This is a natural extension of the plugin architecture once it matures.
