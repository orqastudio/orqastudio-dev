title: Project settings UI for managing delivery types and state machine

acceptance:
  - "Settings UI has a \"Delivery Pipeline\" section showing configured types"
  - "Users can add/edit/remove delivery types with key, label, path, parent relationship"
  - Users can reorder types to change hierarchy
  - "Settings UI has a \"Status Machine\" section showing all statuses with icons, transitions, auto_rules"
  - Users can add/edit/remove statuses
  - Users can configure transitions per status (which statuses it can move to)
  - Users can configure auto_rules per status
  - All changes persist to project.json
  - App refreshes to reflect new configuration without restart
