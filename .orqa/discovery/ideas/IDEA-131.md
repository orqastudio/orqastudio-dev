title: "Production ONNX model download — first-run installer for embedding models"
description: "The ONNX embedding model (BGE-small-en) is too large to bundle with the app. Production environments need a first-run download flow that fetches the model on install, with progress indication, retry logic, and offline fallback."

# IDEA-c48df450: Production Model Download

First-run installer that downloads the ONNX embedding model when the app is installed in production. The existing `ensure_model_exists` pipeline in `search/embedder.rs` already handles download with progress — this idea is about wrapping it in a user-facing setup flow with proper UX (progress bar, retry, offline mode).
