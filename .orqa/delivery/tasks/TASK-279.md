## What

Clean break — remove the old edge fields that have been fully migrated to the relationships array.

## How

1. Verify all deprecated field data is captured in relationships (spot-check each type)
2. Remove fields from schema.json files (propertyOrder, properties, required)
3. Remove fields from all artifact frontmatter
4. Search codebase for references to deprecated fields (pre-commit hook, app scanner, rules, skills)
5. Update any references found
6. Single commit for the entire removal

## Verification

- Search for `evolves-into`, `promoted-from`, `research-refs` across entire `.orqa/` — zero results
- All artifacts pass schema validation
- Pre-commit hook passes
