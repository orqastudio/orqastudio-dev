## What

Built the governance filesystem scanner that recursively walks `.orqa/` directories, parses YAML frontmatter, and classifies artifacts by type.

## How

Implemented the walker in the domain layer using `walkdir`, parsing frontmatter with `serde_yaml` and matching directory paths to artifact type classifications. Results are returned as structured `GovernanceScanResult` via IPC.

## Verification

Scanner discovers all governance artifacts, frontmatter is parsed correctly for each type, and results include file paths, types, and metadata.
