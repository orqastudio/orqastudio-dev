## Why P2

Can't credibly enforce quality on managed projects if our own code has violations. The audit is also a learning loop input — findings feed into lessons and coding standards.

## Tasks

- [ ] Coding standards compliance audit against `.orqa/documentation/development/coding-standards.md`
- [ ] Enforcement artifact review — rules/hooks/skills completeness
- [ ] Abstraction pattern audit — identify over-complicated patterns from iterative development
- [ ] Fix function size violations in `tool_executor.rs` (`tool_bash` 97 lines, `execute_tool` 69 lines, `project_root_from_state` 152 lines)

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
