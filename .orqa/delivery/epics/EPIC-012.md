## Why P1

Pillar 1 (Clarity Through Structure) — governance must be visible, not buried in terminal output.

## Tasks

- [ ] Scanner runner — execute code quality checks (clippy, eslint, tests) and collect results
- [ ] Scanner dashboard — pass/fail history, violation details, trend charts (LayerChart)
- [ ] Metrics dashboard — KPI cards for key project health indicators
- [ ] Agent activity panel — which agent is active, what tools it's using, current task

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
