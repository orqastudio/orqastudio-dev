## What

1. Add `artifacts` array to `.orqa/project.json` with all current groups/types
2. Add Rust types to `project_settings.rs`:
   - `ArtifactTypeConfig { key, label, icon: Option, path }`
   - `ArtifactEntry` untagged enum: `Group { key, label, icon, children }` | `Type(ArtifactTypeConfig)`
3. Add `artifacts: Vec<ArtifactEntry>` to the project config struct

## Config Values

See plan for the full artifacts array. Groups: docs, planning, team, governance.
Types within each group per current `.orqa/` directory structure.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
