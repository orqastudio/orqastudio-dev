# TASK-945e12fa: Search Skill Consolidation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Single `search` skill replaces chunkhound, orqa-code-search, and orqa-native-search
2. Skill documents three tools: search.regex, search.semantic, search.research
3. No context-switching logic (CLI vs App) — MCP is the universal interface
4. Old skills removed from app/.orqa/process/skills/
5. Agent relationships updated (employed-by references)
6. Connector skill sync picks up the new consolidated skill
7. Works for non-code projects (searches content, not "code")
