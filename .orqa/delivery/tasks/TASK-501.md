## What

Add a pre-edit impact panel to the artifact editor. When the user opens an artifact for editing, a collapsible info panel appears showing which other artifacts are reachable within 1-2 relationship hops — giving a quick sense of blast radius before making changes. The panel is non-blocking: it does not prevent editing and can be dismissed or left collapsed.

## How

1. Add a `neighborhood(artifactId, depth)` method to `artifactGraphSDK` that returns all artifacts reachable within `depth` hops (both directions), grouped by the relationship type of the traversed edge.
2. In the artifact editor, derive `impactNeighborhood` from `neighborhood(currentId, 2)` using `$derived`.
3. Render an expandable `<details>` panel (or shadcn Collapsible) above the editor body:
   - Header: "This change may affect N artifacts" (collapsed by default)
   - Expanded: one section per relationship type, each listing affected artifact IDs as `ArtifactLink` components
4. If `impactNeighborhood` is empty or has only 1 entry (the artifact itself), hide the panel entirely.
5. Panel is a pure display component receiving neighborhood data as props — no `invoke()` inside the component.

## Verification

- `neighborhood` unit tests: assert correct 1-hop and 2-hop results for a known graph.
- Component test: panel hidden when neighborhood is empty.
- Component test: panel collapsed by default when neighborhood is non-empty.
- Component test: groups render with correct relationship type labels.
- `make check` passes with zero warnings and zero type errors.
