## What

Defined the complete error taxonomy spanning the Rust OrqaError enum, From trait implementations for cross-module propagation, IPC serialization, and TypeScript discriminated union patterns.

## How

Enumerated all OrqaError variants (FileSystem, Database, Serialization, Sidecar, Governance, NotFound, etc.), documented the From implementations that enable ? propagation, and specified how errors serialize to structured JSON messages consumed by the TypeScript frontend.

## Verification

Error taxonomy documentation covers all domain error cases, From implementations are listed for each module boundary, and IPC serialization format produces meaningful messages for frontend display.
