## What

Add Rust test coverage measurement so we can track the 80% target from [RULE-b49142be](RULE-b49142be).

## How

1. Install cargo-tarpaulin (or configure llvm-cov)
2. Add `make coverage-rust` target to Makefile
3. Document in commands.md
4. Run initial report to establish baseline

## Verification

`make coverage-rust` produces a report with per-module coverage percentages.
