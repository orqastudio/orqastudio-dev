## Pattern

Epics are assigned to milestones via the `milestone` frontmatter field. When epics complete or start work, they can end up on milestones whose status doesn't support that work state.

## Rules

- Completed milestone → all epics must be completed/surpassed
- Active milestone → epics can be any status (this is where work happens)
- Non-active milestone (captured/exploring/ready) → epics should only be captured/exploring/ready

## Fix

When an epic's status changes, validate against its milestone's status. When a milestone status changes, validate all its epics. The transition engine should enforce this as a validation rule.
