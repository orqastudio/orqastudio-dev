# TASK-6827dc2b: code_research Compound Search

## Acceptance Criteria

1. MCP tool `search.research({ question })` implements compound query
2. Pipeline: semantic search → symbol extraction (regex-based) → regex follow-up → assembled context
3. Returns coherent answer with source file paths and relevance
4. No AI dependency for symbol extraction — regex-based pattern matching
5. Exposed via MCP alongside search.regex and search.semantic
