# TASK-afeac1b7: Reset Claude Code Auto-Memory

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Existing Claude Code auto-memory cleared (MEMORY.md and any project-specific memory files)
2. New session starts with a clean slate — no stale references to old sequential IDs, old skill paths, or old connector config
3. First interaction after reset picks up governance context from the connector's prompt injector
4. Auto-memory begins accumulating from governed sources (project context, not hardcoded assumptions)
5. Verify no legacy instructions persist that would conflict with the new connector behaviour
