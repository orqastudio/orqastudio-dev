## What

End-to-end testing of the companion plugin against OrqaStudio's real governance
artifacts. This validates that the plugin works with the actual `.orqa/` directory
structure, not just test fixtures.

## How

1. Install plugin in orqa-studio project
2. Start a Claude Code session — verify SessionStart hook loads orchestrator
3. Run `/orqa:rules` — verify all active rules are listed
4. Run `/orqa:status` — verify governance health metrics
5. Attempt a blocked action (e.g., file with `unwrap()`) — verify PreToolUse blocks it
6. Attempt a normal action — verify it's allowed through
7. Spawn a subagent — verify capabilities are resolved to CLI tools

## Verification

- Test report with evidence for each acceptance criterion
- No false positives (legitimate actions blocked)
- No false negatives (violations allowed through)
