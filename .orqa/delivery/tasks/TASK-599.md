# TASK-15a03760: Skill Sync Refactor

## Acceptance Criteria

1. sync-skills.mjs only syncs skills that need to be proactively available:
   - Agent preload skills (referenced in agent `skills:` frontmatter)
   - Coding standards skills (composability, centralized-logging, best-practices, etc.)
   - Intent-mapped skills (referenced in prompt-injector INTENT_MAP)
2. All other skills available via MCP on demand (graph_query + graph_read)
3. Sync script has a clear list of proactive skills (not "sync everything")
4. Orchestrator prompt documents that non-proactive skills are fetched via MCP
