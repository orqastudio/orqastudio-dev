# TASK-2eeb847c: Enforce Skill Documentation Constraint

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `core.json` updated: `synchronised-with` relationship gets `constraints.required: true, constraints.minCount: 1` when source type is `skill`
2. Integrity scanner reports skills without `synchronised-with` as errors
3. Existing skills flagged correctly (expected: ~70 violations until docs created)
4. Plugin-provided skills included in the check
