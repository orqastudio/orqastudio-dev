## What

Add a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that examines the user's prompt, classifies intent
using a fast AI model call, and injects relevant domain skills as systemMessage.

## How

1. Add `UserPromptSubmit` entry to `hooks.json`
2. Create or extend the hook script to handle prompt events
3. Use a fast model call (Haiku) to classify intent from the prompt
4. Map classified intent to skill names
5. Read and return skill content as systemMessage
6. Dedup against skills already injected in this session

## Verification

- Prompt about "adding a Tauri command" → IPC skills injected
- Prompt about "refactoring a store" → store skills injected
- Skills not re-injected if already loaded
