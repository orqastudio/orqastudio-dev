title: Add bidirectional relationship checking to graph-guardian.mjs
description: Extend the PostToolUse graph-guardian hook to check for missing bidirectional relationship inverses when .orqa/ artifacts are written. Return warnings for one-sided relationships so the agent can fix them immediately.

acceptance:
  - "After Write/Edit on .orqa/**/*.md files, graph-guardian checks for bidirectional inverses"
  - "For each relationship A --type--> B, checks if B has inverse-type --> A"
  - Missing inverses returned as warnings in additionalContext (not blocking)
  - Warning includes the exact relationship entry that should be added to the target artifact
  - Non-.orqa/ files are ignored (no performance impact on code writes)
  - Relationship type/inverse mapping matches RULE-130f1f63 table
relationships:
  - target: EPIC-915291e7
    type: delivers
    rationale: Core task — write-time integrity enforcement for graph consistency
  - target: TASK-70762a1f
    type: depended-on-by

## Scope

### graph-guardian.mjs Changes

Add bidirectional check function:

1. Parse frontmatter of the just-written file
2. Extract `relationships` array
3. For each relationship `{ target, type }`:
   a. Resolve target to file path (e.g., `RULE-532100d9` → `.orqa/process/rules/RULE-532100d9.md`)
   b. Read target file's frontmatter
   c. Check for inverse relationship pointing back
   d. If missing: add to warnings list
4. Return warnings as additionalContext

### Inverse Mapping

```js
const INVERSE_MAP = {
  'observes': 'observed-by',
  'grounded': 'grounded-by',
  'practices': 'practiced-by',
  'enforces': 'enforced-by',
  'verifies': 'verified-by',
  'informs': 'informed-by',
  'delivers': 'delivered-by',
  // Reverse mappings
  'observed-by': 'observes',
  'grounded-by': 'grounded',
  'practiced-by': 'practices',
  'enforced-by': 'enforces',
  'verified-by': 'verifies',
  'informed-by': 'informs',
  'delivered-by': 'delivers',
};
```

### Performance

- Only runs on `.orqa/**/*.md` writes (guard at top of function)
- Single-file check per write — reads only the target files referenced in relationships
- Typical artifact has 3-8 relationships — reads 3-8 files per check
- Total: ~50ms per artifact write
