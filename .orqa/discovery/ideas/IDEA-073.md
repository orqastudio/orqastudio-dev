## Motivation

During dogfooding, visual rough edges are noticeable — the favicon and titlebar icon are still defaults, and there is visible spacing above and below the close button hover state that looks messy. These small details undermine the sense of a polished product even when the underlying functionality works well.

This should be scoped as a focused UI polish pass for the Dogfood milestone.
