Software architecture is the set of decisions that are difficult to change later. This skill covers how to identify architecturally significant changes, how to document decisions as ADRs, and how to evaluate implementation plans for compliance with established principles.

See this project's architecture decisions documentation for project-specific decisions.

## Quick Start

### Is This Change Architecturally Significant?

A change is architecturally significant if it:

- Crosses a layer boundary (introduces a new dependency between frontend and backend)
- Changes an IPC contract (command signature, response type, event shape)
- Introduces new persistent state (new table, new config file, new file format)
- Changes how a capability is routed (adds a new integration, changes selection logic)
- Establishes a new pattern that will be followed by future work

If any of these apply, document an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) before implementing.

### ADR Format

```markdown
## AD-XXX: Title (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Status:** Proposed | Active | Superseded by AD-YYY

**Decision:**
What was decided. Be specific.

**Rationale:**
Why this approach was chosen over alternatives.

**Consequences:**
What follows from the decision — both positive and negative.
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| ADR (Architecture Decision Record) | Documented decision with context, rationale, consequences | Architecturally significant changes |
| Thick backend | Domain logic in the backend, frontend is a view layer | All business logic placement decisions |
| IPC boundary | Typed command interface between frontend and backend | Any cross-layer communication |
| Repository pattern | Isolates persistence behind a trait interface | Database access, file system access |
| Domain types | Strongly-typed models that represent business concepts | Core data structures |
| Newtype pattern | Wrapper types for domain identifiers | IDs, keys, handles |
| Data flow mapping | Tracing a request from UI to persistence layer | Pre-implementation analysis |

## Data Flow Mapping

Before implementing any cross-layer feature, trace the full request path:

```text
Svelte Component (UI interaction)
  → Runes Store (local state management)
    → invoke() call (typed IPC boundary)
      → #[tauri::command] handler (validation + orchestration)
        → Domain function (pure business logic)
          → Repository trait (persistence interface)
            → SQLite / File System (actual storage)
```

Map every hop before writing code. Identify which layers need to change.

## Common Patterns

### Repository Pattern (Rust)

Isolate persistence behind a trait so it can be swapped without changing business logic:

```text
Domain Layer (pure logic)
    calls ↓
Repository Trait (interface contract)
    implements ↓         implements ↓
SqliteRepository      InMemoryRepository
(production)          (tests)
```

The domain layer depends only on the trait. Implementations are injected at startup. Tests inject the in-memory version.

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility | Location |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| UI Components | Render data, capture user input | `ui/src/lib/components/` |
| Pages/Containers | Fetch data via `invoke()`, manage loading states | `ui/src/routes/` |
| Runes Stores | Client-side state, cache, optimistic updates | `ui/src/lib/stores/` |
| IPC Commands | Validate input, orchestrate domain calls, serialize response | `backend/src-tauri/src/commands/` |
| Domain | Business logic, pure functions, type definitions | `backend/src-tauri/src/domain/` |
| Persistence | SQLite queries, file I/O, external API calls | `backend/src-tauri/src/repo/` |

### Identifying Architectural Violations

| Violation | Symptom | Correct Pattern |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Business logic in frontend | Component contains domain rules or calculations | Move to Rust domain layer |
| Direct DB access in commands | Command handler writes SQL directly | Use repository trait |
| Component fetches data | `invoke()` call inside a component in `$lib/components/` | Move fetch to page/container |
| Svelte 4 patterns | `export let`, `$:`, `<slot>` | Use runes: `$props()`, `$derived()`, `{#snippet}` |
| Unwrap in production | `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` in non-test code | Return `Result<T, E>` |
| Hardcoded SQL in domain | Domain function contains SQL strings | Domain calls repository trait |

### IPC Boundary Design

Every feature that crosses the boundary needs:

1. **Rust command** — `#[tauri::command]` function in `commands/`
2. **Rust types** — Request/response types with `Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone`
3. **TypeScript types** — Mirror types in the frontend
4. **Store method** — Typed `invoke()` wrapper in a `.svelte.ts` store

```text
Rust:
  #[tauri::command]
  pub async fn create_session(name: String) -> Result<Session, String>

TypeScript:
  async function createSession(name: string): Promise<Session> {
    return invoke('create_session', { name })
  }
```

### Error Propagation

```text
Domain Error (typed enum with thiserror)
  → Command Handler (maps domain error to Result<T, String>)
    → IPC Boundary (Tauri serializes to JSON)
      → Frontend Store (catches error, sets error state)
        → Component (renders error message)
```

Every layer has a responsibility in the error chain. No layer swallows errors silently.

## Compliance Review Checklist

Use this when reviewing an implementation plan:

- [ ] Is any business logic in the frontend? (If yes: move to Rust domain layer)
- [ ] Is any data fetching in a display component? (If yes: move to page/container)
- [ ] Does any command handler bypass the domain layer? (If yes: add domain function)
- [ ] Is any new persistent state managed outside SQLite? (If yes: justify or move)
- [ ] Does any new Rust function use unwrap/expect/panic? (If yes: return Result)
- [ ] Are all new IPC types mirrored in both Rust and TypeScript?
- [ ] Is an ADR needed for this change? (If yes: write it before implementation begins)
