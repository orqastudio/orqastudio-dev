# IDEA-66d2cbeb: Native ONNX Embeddings Server

## Problem

Search and skill matching currently rely on either ChunkHound (third-party MCP) or internal Rust calls that aren't exposed to external consumers. The search engine spins up per-session, re-embeds on demand, and has no pre-processing pipeline. Agents start cold — no semantic context is ready until they search.

## Concept

A persistent, hardware-accelerated embeddings server built into the app:

### Hardware Detection
1. **NPU** (Neural Processing Unit) — if available, fastest and most power-efficient
2. **DirectML GPU** — already supported via `ort` directml feature
3. **CUDA GPU** — for NVIDIA hardware
4. **CPU fallback** — always available, slowest but reliable

Detection at startup, with user override in settings.

### MCP Interface
Exposed as MCP tools alongside the artifact graph:
- `search.regex({ pattern, paths? })` — regex search across indexed content
- `search.semantic({ query, limit? })` — cosine similarity against pre-computed embeddings
- `search.research({ question })` — compound query: semantic → symbol extraction → regex follow-up → assembled context
- `embeddings.embed({ texts })` — raw embedding API for custom use
- `embeddings.status()` — index health, hardware info, model version

### Pre-Processing Pipeline
- **File watcher** triggers re-embedding on `.orqa/` file save
- **Artifact graph changes** trigger relationship-aware re-indexing
- **Session start** — embeddings are already warm, no cold start delay
- **Incremental** — only re-embed changed chunks, not the full corpus

### Orchestrator Integration
Before delegating, the orchestrator can:
```
search.semantic({ query: "svelte component state management" })
→ returns top-5 relevant skills by cosine similarity
→ orchestrator injects those skills into the delegation prompt
```

This replaces keyword-based intent mapping with semantic matching — the prompt injector becomes a semantic skill matcher.

### Replaces
- ChunkHound MCP server dependency
- `orqa-code-search` context-switching skill
- `orqa-native-search` skill
- Keyword-based prompt injector intent mapping

### Enables
- In-app agent framework with pre-processed semantic context
- Non-code projects using semantic search (consulting, research, governance)
- Smarter skill injection based on meaning, not keywords
- Real-time "related artifacts" suggestions in the app UI

```

## Existing Infrastructure
- `ort` 2.0 with DirectML — already in Cargo.toml
- `search/embedder.rs` — ONNX model loading, batch embedding
- `search/store.rs` — DuckDB vector storage, regex + semantic search
- `search/chunker.rs` — file chunking pipeline
- BGE-small-en model download pipeline — already implemented
- File watcher (`notify` crate) — already in use for artifact graph

## Key Design Considerations
- The server should be a separate process (sidecar) or a mode of the main binary (`--embeddings-server`)
- Pre-processing should be non-blocking — don't slow down file saves
- The DuckDB index should persist across sessions (already does)
- Model download should happen once, not per-session (already implemented)
- NPU detection needs platform-specific code (Windows WinML, macOS CoreML)
