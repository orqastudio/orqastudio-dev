acceptance:
  - Research schema includes relationships array matching the standard relationship pattern
  - "All research documents have relationship data backfilled (at minimum, informs edges to epics that reference them)"
  - Bidirectional consistency verified — epic research-refs have matching research→epic relationships
  - All epics have horizon field populated (active/next/later/someday/null)
  - verify-links passes clean after backfill
relationships:
  - target: EPIC-fd22ca6c
    type: delivers
    rationale: Theme G — data integrity backfill from UAT

## Scope

### Research Schema Update (Finding #21)
- **Current**: `.orqa/delivery/research/schema.json` has NO `relationships` field
- **Fix**: Add `relationships` array matching the pattern used in rules, skills, ideas, etc.
- **Backfill**: For each RES-NNN, add at minimum the `informs` relationship to any epic that lists it in `research-refs`

### Epic Horizon Backfill (Finding #25)
- **Current**: `horizon` field exists in epic schema but zero epics have it populated
- **Fix**: Populate all epics with appropriate horizon value based on milestone status
