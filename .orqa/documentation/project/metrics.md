## How to Update

The `agent-maintainer` updates this table during retrospective entries:

1. When reviewing lessons in `.orqa/process/lessons/`, also update the relevant metrics
2. Fill in the Period column with the date range being measured
3. Update the Value column with the current measurement
4. Set the Trend column to one of: improving, stable, declining, or -- (insufficient data)
5. Add context in the Notes column explaining significant changes

## Metric Definitions

### Review Failure Rate

**Formula:** Number of `code-reviewer` FAIL verdicts / total code reviews conducted

**Why it matters:** A high failure rate indicates agents are not following coding standards or making the same mistakes repeatedly. A declining rate indicates the learning loops are working.

### Lesson Promotion Rate

**Formula:** IMPL entries with a non-empty "Promoted to" field / total IMPL entries

**Why it matters:** Lessons that are documented but never promoted to rules or standards don't prevent recurrence. A low promotion rate means the learning loop is incomplete.

### DoR Compliance

**Formula:** Tasks where all applicable Definition of Ready items were verified / total tasks started

**Why it matters:** Tasks that skip DoR often require rework. Measuring compliance highlights whether the gate is being enforced.

### DoD Compliance

**Formula:** Tasks where all applicable Definition of Done items were verified / total tasks completed

**Why it matters:** Tasks that skip DoD may be reported as complete but have gaps.

### Context Window Incidents

**Formula:** Count of sessions that ended prematurely due to context window overflow

**Why it matters:** Context overflow causes lost work and session restarts. A declining count indicates the context management rules are effective.

### Stale Worktree Incidents

**Formula:** Count of worktrees found unmerged at session start

**Why it matters:** Stale worktrees indicate incomplete task cleanup, risk merge conflicts, and can cause data loss.

### Build Verification Pass Rate

**Formula:** Number of `cargo build && npm run build` runs that succeed after merge / total merges

**Why it matters:** A failing post-merge build indicates the merge introduced integration issues. Tracking this helps catch regressions early.

### Skill Load Rate

**Formula:** Number of skills actually loaded per session / total available skills

**Why it matters:** Skills that are never loaded may be unnecessary or poorly targeted. Skills that are always loaded may need to be made universal.
